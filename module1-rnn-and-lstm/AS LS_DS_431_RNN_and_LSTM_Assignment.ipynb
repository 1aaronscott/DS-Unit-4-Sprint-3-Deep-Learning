    "Note - Shakespeare wrote an awful lot. It's OK, especially initially, to sample/use smaller data and parameters, so you can have a tighter feedback loop when you're trying to get things running. Then, once you've got a proof of concept - start pushing it more!"

    "## Stretch goals:\n",
    "- Refine the training and generation of text to be able to ask for different genres/styles of Shakespearean text (e.g. plays versus sonnets)\n",
    "- Train a classification model that takes text and returns which work of Shakespeare it is most likely to be from\n",
    "- Make it more performant! Many possible routes here - lean on Keras, optimize the code, and/or use more resources (AWS, etc.)\n",
    "- Revisit the news example from class, and improve it - use categories or tags to refine the model/generation, or train a news classifier\n",
    "- Run on bigger, better data\n",
