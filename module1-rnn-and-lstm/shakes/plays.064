SCENE: Britain; Italy.


ACT I

SCENE I. Britain. The garden of Cymbeline_s palace.

 Enter two Gentlemen.

FIRST GENTLEMAN.
You do not meet a man but frowns; our bloods
No more obey the heavens than our courtiers
Still seem as does the King_s.

SECOND GENTLEMAN.
But what_s the matter?

FIRST GENTLEMAN.
His daughter, and the heir of_s kingdom, whom
He purpos_d to his wife’s sole son—a widow
That late he married—hath referr_d herself
Unto a poor but worthy gentleman. She_s wedded;
Her husband banish_d; she imprison’d. All
Is outward sorrow, though I think the King
Be touch_d at very heart.

SECOND GENTLEMAN.
None but the King?

FIRST GENTLEMAN.
He that hath lost her too. So is the Queen,
That most desir_d the match. But not a courtier,
Although they wear their faces to the bent
Of the King_s looks, hath a heart that is not
Glad at the thing they scowl at.

SECOND GENTLEMAN.
And why so?

FIRST GENTLEMAN.
He that hath miss_d the Princess is a thing
Too bad for bad report; and he that hath her—
I mean that married her, alack, good man!
And therefore banish_d—is a creature such
As, to seek through the regions of the earth
For one his like, there would be something failing
In him that should compare. I do not think
So fair an outward and such stuff within
Endows a man but he.

SECOND GENTLEMAN.
You speak him far.

FIRST GENTLEMAN.
I do extend him, sir, within himself;
Crush him together rather than unfold
His measure duly.

SECOND GENTLEMAN.
What_s his name and birth?

FIRST GENTLEMAN.
I cannot delve him to the root; his father
Was call_d Sicilius, who did join his honour
Against the Romans with Cassibelan,
But had his titles by Tenantius, whom
He serv_d with glory and admir’d success,
So gain_d the sur-addition Leonatus;
And had, besides this gentleman in question,
Two other sons, who, in the wars o_ th’ time,
Died with their swords in hand; for which their father,
Then old and fond of issue, took such sorrow
That he quit being; and his gentle lady,
Big of this gentleman, our theme, deceas_d
As he was born. The King he takes the babe
To his protection, calls him Posthumus Leonatus,
Breeds him and makes him of his bed-chamber,
Puts to him all the learnings that his time
Could make him the receiver of; which he took,
As we do air, fast as _twas minist’red,
And in_s spring became a harvest, liv’d in court—
Which rare it is to do—most prais_d, most lov’d,
A sample to the youngest; to th_ more mature
A glass that feated them; and to the graver
A child that guided dotards. To his mistress,
For whom he now is banish_d, her own price
Proclaims how she esteem_d him and his virtue;
By her election may be truly read
What kind of man he is.

SECOND GENTLEMAN.
I honour him
Even out of your report. But pray you tell me,
Is she sole child to th_ King?

FIRST GENTLEMAN.
His only child.
He had two sons—if this be worth your hearing,
Mark it—the eldest of them at three years old,
I_ th’ swathing clothes the other, from their nursery
Were stol_n; and to this hour no guess in knowledge
Which way they went.

SECOND GENTLEMAN.
How long is this ago?

FIRST GENTLEMAN.
Some twenty years.

SECOND GENTLEMAN.
That a king_s children should be so convey’d,
So slackly guarded, and the search so slow
That could not trace them!

FIRST GENTLEMAN.
Howsoe_er ’tis strange,
Or that the negligence may well be laugh_d at,
Yet is it true, sir.

SECOND GENTLEMAN.
I do well believe you.

FIRST GENTLEMAN.
We must forbear; here comes the gentleman,
The Queen, and Princess.

 [_Exeunt._]

SCENE II. The same.

 Enter Queen, Posthumus and Imogen.

QUEEN.
No, be assur_d you shall not find me, daughter,
After the slander of most stepmothers,
Evil-ey_d unto you. You’re my prisoner, but
Your gaoler shall deliver you the keys
That lock up your restraint. For you, Posthumus,
So soon as I can win th_ offended King,
I will be known your advocate. Marry, yet
The fire of rage is in him, and _twere good
You lean_d unto his sentence with what patience
Your wisdom may inform you.

POSTHUMUS.
Please your Highness,
I will from hence today.

QUEEN.
You know the peril.
I_ll fetch a turn about the garden, pitying
The pangs of barr_d affections, though the King
Hath charg_d you should not speak together.

 [_Exit._]

IMOGEN.
O dissembling courtesy! How fine this tyrant
Can tickle where she wounds! My dearest husband,
I something fear my father_s wrath, but nothing
(Always reserv_d my holy duty) what
His rage can do on me. You must be gone;
And I shall here abide the hourly shot
Of angry eyes, not comforted to live
But that there is this jewel in the world
That I may see again.

POSTHUMUS.
My queen! my mistress!
O lady, weep no more, lest I give cause
To be suspected of more tenderness
Than doth become a man. I will remain
The loyal_st husband that did e’er plight troth;
My residence in Rome at one Philario_s,
Who to my father was a friend, to me
Known but by letter; thither write, my queen,
And with mine eyes I_ll drink the words you send,
Though ink be made of gall.

 Enter Queen.

QUEEN.
Be brief, I pray you.
If the King come, I shall incur I know not
How much of his displeasure. [_Aside._] Yet I_ll move him
To walk this way. I never do him wrong
But he does buy my injuries, to be friends;
Pays dear for my offences.

 [_Exit._]

POSTHUMUS.
Should we be taking leave
As long a term as yet we have to live,
The loathness to depart would grow. Adieu!

IMOGEN.
Nay, stay a little.
Were you but riding forth to air yourself,
Such parting were too petty. Look here, love:
This diamond was my mother_s; take it, heart;
But keep it till you woo another wife,
When Imogen is dead.

POSTHUMUS.
How, how? Another?
You gentle gods, give me but this I have,
And sear up my embracements from a next
With bonds of death! Remain, remain thou here

 [_Puts on the ring._]

While sense can keep it on. And, sweetest, fairest,
As I my poor self did exchange for you,
To your so infinite loss, so in our trifles
I still win of you. For my sake wear this;
It is a manacle of love; I_ll place it
Upon this fairest prisoner.

 [_Puts a bracelet on her arm._]

IMOGEN.
O the gods!
When shall we see again?

 Enter Cymbeline and Lords.

POSTHUMUS.
Alack, the King!

CYMBELINE.
Thou basest thing, avoid; hence from my sight
If after this command thou fraught the court
With thy unworthiness, thou diest. Away!
Thou_rt poison to my blood.

POSTHUMUS.
The gods protect you,
And bless the good remainders of the court!
I am gone.

 [_Exit._]
