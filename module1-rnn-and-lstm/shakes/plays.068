My lord, I fear,
Has forgot Britain.

IACHIMO.
And himself. Not I
Inclin_d to this intelligence pronounce
The beggary of his change; but _tis your graces
That from my mutest conscience to my tongue
Charms this report out.

IMOGEN.
Let me hear no more.

IACHIMO.
O dearest soul, your cause doth strike my heart
With pity that doth make me sick! A lady
So fair, and fasten_d to an empery,
Would make the great_st king double, to be partner’d
With tomboys hir_d with that self exhibition
Which your own coffers yield! with diseas_d ventures
That play with all infirmities for gold
Which rottenness can lend nature! Such boil_d stuff
As well might poison poison! Be reveng_d;
Or she that bore you was no queen, and you
Recoil from your great stock.

IMOGEN.
Reveng_d?
How should I be reveng_d? If this be true,
(As I have such a heart that both mine ears
Must not in haste abuse) if it be true,
How should I be reveng_d?

IACHIMO.
Should he make me
Live like Diana_s priest betwixt cold sheets,
Whiles he is vaulting variable ramps,
In your despite, upon your purse? Revenge it.
I dedicate myself to your sweet pleasure,
More noble than that runagate to your bed,
And will continue fast to your affection,
Still close as sure.

IMOGEN.
What ho, Pisanio!

IACHIMO.
Let me my service tender on your lips.

IMOGEN.
Away! I do condemn mine ears that have
So long attended thee. If thou wert honourable,
Thou wouldst have told this tale for virtue, not
For such an end thou seek_st, as base as strange.
Thou wrong_st a gentleman who is as far
From thy report as thou from honour; and
Solicits here a lady that disdains
Thee and the devil alike. What ho, Pisanio!
The King my father shall be made acquainted
Of thy assault. If he shall think it fit
A saucy stranger in his court to mart
As in a Romish stew, and to expound
His beastly mind to us, he hath a court
He little cares for, and a daughter who
He not respects at all. What ho, Pisanio!

IACHIMO.
O happy Leonatus! I may say
The credit that thy lady hath of thee
Deserves thy trust, and thy most perfect goodness
Her assur_d credit. Blessed live you long,
A lady to the worthiest sir that ever
Country call_d his! and you his mistress, only
For the most worthiest fit! Give me your pardon.
I have spoke this to know if your affiance
Were deeply rooted, and shall make your lord
That which he is new o_er; and he is one
The truest manner_d, such a holy witch
That he enchants societies into him,
Half all men_s hearts are his.

IMOGEN.
You make amends.

IACHIMO.
He sits _mongst men like a descended god:
He hath a kind of honour sets him off
More than a mortal seeming. Be not angry,
Most mighty Princess, that I have adventur_d
To try your taking of a false report, which hath
Honour_d with confirmation your great judgement
In the election of a sir so rare,
Which you know cannot err. The love I bear him
Made me to fan you thus; but the gods made you,
Unlike all others, chaffless. Pray your pardon.

IMOGEN.
All_s well, sir; take my pow’r i’ th’ court for yours.

IACHIMO.
My humble thanks. I had almost forgot
T_ entreat your Grace but in a small request,
And yet of moment too, for it concerns
Your lord; myself and other noble friends
Are partners in the business.

IMOGEN.
Pray what is_t?

IACHIMO.
Some dozen Romans of us, and your lord
(The best feather of our wing) have mingled sums
To buy a present for the Emperor;
Which I, the factor for the rest, have done
In France. _Tis plate of rare device, and jewels
Of rich and exquisite form, their values great;
And I am something curious, being strange,
To have them in safe stowage. May it please you
To take them in protection?

IMOGEN.
Willingly;
And pawn mine honour for their safety. Since
My lord hath interest in them, I will keep them
In my bedchamber.

IACHIMO.
They are in a trunk,
Attended by my men. I will make bold
To send them to you only for this night;
I must aboard tomorrow.

IMOGEN.
O, no, no.

IACHIMO.
Yes, I beseech; or I shall short my word
By length_ning my return. From Gallia
I cross_d the seas on purpose and on promise
To see your Grace.

IMOGEN.
I thank you for your pains.
But not away tomorrow!

IACHIMO.
O, I must, madam.
Therefore I shall beseech you, if you please
To greet your lord with writing, do_t tonight.
I have outstood my time, which is material
To th_ tender of our present.

IMOGEN.
I will write.
Send your trunk to me; it shall safe be kept
And truly yielded you. You_re very welcome.

 [_Exeunt._]



ACT II

SCENE I. Britain. Before Cymbeline_s palace.

 Enter Cloten and the two Lords.

CLOTEN.
Was there ever man had such luck! When I kiss_d the jack, upon an
upcast to be hit away! I had a hundred pound on_t; and then a whoreson
jackanapes must take me up for swearing, as if I borrowed mine oaths of
him, and might not spend them at my pleasure.

FIRST LORD.
What got he by that? You have broke his pate with your bowl.

SECOND LORD.
[_Aside._] If his wit had been like him that broke it, it would have
run all out.

CLOTEN.
When a gentleman is dispos_d to swear, it is not for any standers-by to
curtail his oaths. Ha?

SECOND LORD.
No, my lord; [_Aside._] nor crop the ears of them.

CLOTEN.
Whoreson dog! I gave him satisfaction. Would he had been one of my
rank!

SECOND LORD.
[_Aside._] To have smell_d like a fool.

CLOTEN.
I am not vex_d more at anything in th’ earth. A pox on’t! I had rather
not be so noble as I am; they dare not fight with me, because of the
Queen my mother. Every jackslave hath his bellyful of fighting, and I
must go up and down like a cock that nobody can match.

SECOND LORD.
[_Aside._] You are cock and capon too; and you crow, cock, with your
comb on.

CLOTEN.
Sayest thou?

SECOND LORD.
It is not fit your lordship should undertake every companion that you
give offence to.

CLOTEN.
No, I know that; but it is fit I should commit offence to my inferiors.

SECOND LORD.
Ay, it is fit for your lordship only.

CLOTEN.
Why, so I say.

FIRST LORD.
Did you hear of a stranger that_s come to court tonight?

CLOTEN.
A stranger, and I not known on_t?

SECOND LORD.
[_Aside._] He_s a strange fellow himself, and knows it not.

FIRST LORD.
There_s an Italian come, and, ’tis thought, one of Leonatus’ friends.

CLOTEN.
Leonatus? A banish_d rascal; and he’s another, whatsoever he be. Who
told you of this stranger?

FIRST LORD.
One of your lordship_s pages.

CLOTEN.
Is it fit I went to look upon him? Is there no derogation in_t?

SECOND LORD.
You cannot derogate, my lord.

CLOTEN.
Not easily, I think.

SECOND LORD.
[_Aside._] You are a fool granted; therefore your issues, being
foolish, do not derogate.

CLOTEN.
Come, I_ll go see this Italian. What I have lost today at bowls I’ll
win tonight of him. Come, go.

SECOND LORD.
I_ll attend your lordship.

 [_Exeunt Cloten and First Lord._]

That such a crafty devil as is his mother
Should yield the world this ass! A woman that
Bears all down with her brain; and this her son
Cannot take two from twenty, for his heart,
And leave eighteen. Alas, poor princess,
Thou divine Imogen, what thou endur_st,
Betwixt a father by thy step-dame govern_d,
A mother hourly coining plots, a wooer
More hateful than the foul expulsion is
Of thy dear husband, than that horrid act
Of the divorce he_d make! The heavens hold firm
The walls of thy dear honour, keep unshak_d
That temple, thy fair mind, that thou mayst stand
T_ enjoy thy banish’d lord and this great land!

 [_Exit._]

SCENE II. Britain. Imogen_s bedchamber in Cymbeline’s palace; a trunk
in one corner.

 Enter Immogen in her bed, and a Lady attending.

IMOGEN.
Who_s there? My woman Helen?

LADY.
Please you, madam.

IMOGEN.
What hour is it?

LADY.
Almost midnight, madam.

IMOGEN.
I have read three hours then. Mine eyes are weak;
Fold down the leaf where I have left. To bed.
Take not away the taper, leave it burning;
And if thou canst awake by four o_ th’ clock,
