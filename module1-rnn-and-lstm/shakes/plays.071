PHILARIO.
Have patience, sir,
And take your ring again; _tis not yet won.
It may be probable she lost it, or
Who knows if one her women, being corrupted
Hath stol_n it from her?

POSTHUMUS.
Very true;
And so I hope he came by_t. Back my ring.
Render to me some corporal sign about her,
More evident than this; for this was stol_n.

IACHIMO.
By Jupiter, I had it from her arm!

POSTHUMUS.
Hark you, he swears; by Jupiter he swears.
_Tis true, nay, keep the ring, ’tis true. I am sure
She would not lose it. Her attendants are
All sworn and honourable:—they induc_d to steal it!
And by a stranger! No, he hath enjoy_d her.
The cognizance of her incontinency
Is this: she hath bought the name of whore thus dearly.
There, take thy hire; and all the fiends of hell
Divide themselves between you!


PHILARIO.
Sir, be patient;
This is not strong enough to be believ_d
Of one persuaded well of.

POSTHUMUS.
Never talk on_t;
She hath been colted by him.

IACHIMO.
If you seek
For further satisfying, under her breast
(Worthy the pressing) lies a mole, right proud
Of that most delicate lodging. By my life,
I kiss_d it; and it gave me present hunger
To feed again, though full. You do remember
This stain upon her?

POSTHUMUS.
Ay, and it doth confirm
Another stain, as big as hell can hold,
Were there no more but it.

IACHIMO.
Will you hear more?

POSTHUMUS.
Spare your arithmetic; never count the turns.
Once, and a million!

IACHIMO.
I_ll be sworn—

POSTHUMUS.
No swearing.
If you will swear you have not done_t, you lie;
And I will kill thee if thou dost deny
Thou_st made me cuckold.

IACHIMO.
I_ll deny nothing.

POSTHUMUS.
O that I had her here to tear her limb-meal!
I will go there and do_t, i’ th’ court, before
Her father. I_ll do something—

 [_Exit._]

PHILARIO.
Quite besides
The government of patience! You have won.
Let_s follow him and pervert the present wrath
He hath against himself.

IACHIMO.
With all my heart.

 [_Exeunt._]

SCENE V. Rome. Another room in Philario_s house.

 Enter Posthumus.

POSTHUMUS.
Is there no way for men to be, but women
Must be half-workers? We are all bastards,
And that most venerable man which I
Did call my father was I know not where
When I was stamp_d. Some coiner with his tools
Made me a counterfeit; yet my mother seem_d
The Dian of that time. So doth my wife
The nonpareil of this. O, vengeance, vengeance!
Me of my lawful pleasure she restrain_d,
And pray_d me oft forbearance; did it with
A pudency so rosy, the sweet view on_t
Might well have warm_d old Saturn; that I thought her
As chaste as unsunn_d snow. O, all the devils!
This yellow Iachimo in an hour, was_t not?
Or less; at first? Perchance he spoke not, but,
Like a full-acorn_d boar, a German one,
Cried “O!” and mounted; found no opposition
But what he look_d for should oppose and she
Should from encounter guard. Could I find out
The woman_s part in me! For there’s no motion
That tends to vice in man but I affirm
It is the woman_s part. Be it lying, note it,
The woman_s; flattering, hers; deceiving, hers;
Lust and rank thoughts, hers, hers; revenges, hers;
Ambitions, covetings, change of prides, disdain,
Nice longing, slanders, mutability,
All faults that man may name, nay, that hell knows,
Why, hers, in part or all; but rather all;
For even to vice
They are not constant, but are changing still
One vice but of a minute old for one
Not half so old as that. I_ll write against them,
Detest them, curse them. Yet _tis greater skill
In a true hate to pray they have their will:
The very devils cannot plague them better.

 [_Exit._]



ACT III

SCENE I. Britain. A hall in Cymbeline_s palace.

 Enter in state Cymbeline, Queen, Cloten and Lords at one door, and at
 another Caius Lucius and Attendants.

CYMBELINE.
Now say, what would Augustus Cæsar with us?

LUCIUS.
When Julius Cæsar, (whose remembrance yet
Lives in men_s eyes, and will to ears and tongues
Be theme and hearing ever) was in this Britain,
And conquer_d it, Cassibelan, thine uncle,
Famous in Cæsar_s praises no whit less
Than in his feats deserving it, for him
And his succession granted Rome a tribute,
Yearly three thousand pounds, which by thee lately
Is left untender_d.

QUEEN.
And, to kill the marvel,
Shall be so ever.

CLOTEN.
There be many Cæsars ere such another Julius. Britain is a world by
itself, and we will nothing pay for wearing our own noses.

QUEEN.
That opportunity,
Which then they had to take from_s, to resume
We have again. Remember, sir, my liege,
The kings your ancestors, together with
The natural bravery of your isle, which stands
As Neptune_s park, ribb’d and pal’d in
With rocks unscaleable and roaring waters,
With sands that will not bear your enemies_ boats
But suck them up to th_ top-mast. A kind of conquest
Cæsar made here, but made not here his brag
Of ‘Came, and saw, and overcame._ With shame
(The first that ever touch_d him) he was carried
From off our coast, twice beaten; and his shipping
(Poor ignorant baubles!) on our terrible seas,
Like egg-shells mov_d upon their surges, crack’d
As easily _gainst our rocks; for joy whereof
The fam_d Cassibelan, who was once at point
(O, giglot fortune!) to master Cæsar_s sword,
Made Lud_s Town with rejoicing fires bright
And Britons strut with courage.

CLOTEN.
Come, there_s no more tribute to be paid. Our kingdom is stronger than
it was at that time; and, as I said, there is no moe such Cæsars. Other
of them may have crook_d noses; but to owe such straight arms, none.

CYMBELINE.
Son, let your mother end.

CLOTEN.
We have yet many among us can gripe as hard as Cassibelan. I do not say
I am one; but I have a hand. Why tribute? Why should we pay tribute? If
Cæsar can hide the sun from us with a blanket, or put the moon in his
pocket, we will pay him tribute for light; else, sir, no more tribute,
pray you now.

CYMBELINE.
You must know,
Till the injurious Romans did extort
This tribute from us, we were free. Cæsar_s ambition,
Which swell_d so much that it did almost stretch
The sides o_ th’ world, against all colour here
Did put the yoke upon_s; which to shake of
Becomes a warlike people, whom we reckon
Ourselves to be.

CLOTEN.
We do.

CYMBELINE.
Say then to Cæsar,
Our ancestor was that Mulmutius which
Ordain_d our laws, whose use the sword of Cæsar
Hath too much mangled; whose repair and franchise
Shall, by the power we hold, be our good deed,
Though Rome be therefore angry. Mulmutius made our laws,
Who was the first of Britain which did put
His brows within a golden crown, and call_d
Himself a king.

LUCIUS.
I am sorry, Cymbeline,
That I am to pronounce Augustus Cæsar
(Cæsar, that hath moe kings his servants than
Thyself domestic officers) thine enemy.
Receive it from me, then: war and confusion
In Cæsar_s name pronounce I ’gainst thee; look
For fury not to be resisted. Thus defied,
I thank thee for myself.

CYMBELINE.
Thou art welcome, Caius.
Thy Cæsar knighted me; my youth I spent
Much under him; of him I gather_d honour,
Which he to seek of me again, perforce,
Behoves me keep at utterance. I am perfect
That the Pannonians and Dalmatians for
Their liberties are now in arms, a precedent
Which not to read would show the Britons cold;
So Cæsar shall not find them.

LUCIUS.
Let proof speak.

CLOTEN.
His majesty bids you welcome. Make pastime with us a day or two, or
longer. If you seek us afterwards in other terms, you shall find us in
our salt-water girdle. If you beat us out of it, it is yours; if you
fall in the adventure, our crows shall fare the better for you; and
there_s an end.

LUCIUS.
So, sir.

CYMBELINE.
I know your master_s pleasure, and he mine;
All the remain is, welcome.

 [_Exeunt._]

SCENE II. Britain. Another room in Cymbeline_s palace.

 Enter Pisanio reading of a letter.

PISANIO.
How? of adultery? Wherefore write you not
What monsters her accuse? Leonatus!
O master, what a strange infection
Is fall_n into thy ear! What false Italian
(As poisonous-tongu_d as handed) hath prevail’d
On thy too ready hearing? Disloyal? No.
She_s punish’d for her truth, and undergoes,
More goddess-like than wife-like, such assaults
As would take in some virtue. O my master,
Thy mind to her is now as low as were
Thy fortunes. How? that I should murder her?
Upon the love, and truth, and vows, which I
Have made to thy command? I, her? Her blood?
If it be so to do good service, never
Let me be counted serviceable. How look I
That I should seem to lack humanity
So much as this fact comes to?

 [_Reads._]

‘Do_t. The letter
That I have sent her, by her own command
Shall give thee opportunity._ O damn’d paper,
Black as the ink that_s on thee! Senseless bauble,
Art thou a fedary for this act, and look_st
So virgin-like without? Lo, here she comes.

 Enter Imogen.

I am ignorant in what I am commanded.

IMOGEN.
