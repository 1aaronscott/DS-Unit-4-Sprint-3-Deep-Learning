How now, Pisanio?

PISANIO.
Madam, here is a letter from my lord.

IMOGEN.
Who? thy lord? That is my lord, Leonatus?
O, learn_d indeed were that astronomer
That knew the stars as I his characters;
He_d lay the future open. You good gods,
Let what is here contain_d relish of love,
Of my lord_s health, of his content; yet not
That we two are asunder; let that grieve him!
Some griefs are med_cinable; that is one of them,
For it doth physic love: of his content,
All but in that. Good wax, thy leave. Blest be
You bees that make these locks of counsel! Lovers
And men in dangerous bonds pray not alike;
Though forfeiters you cast in prison, yet
You clasp young Cupid_s tables. Good news, gods!

 [_Reads._]

_Justice and your father_s wrath, should he take me in his dominion,
could not be so cruel to me as you, O the dearest of creatures, would
even renew me with your eyes. Take notice that I am in Cambria, at
Milford Haven. What your own love will out of this advise you, follow.
So he wishes you all happiness that remains loyal to his vow, and your
increasing in love.
                    LEONATUS POSTHUMUS._

O for a horse with wings! Hear_st thou, Pisanio?
He is at Milford Haven. Read, and tell me
How far _tis thither. If one of mean affairs
May plod it in a week, why may not I
Glide thither in a day? Then, true Pisanio,
Who long_st like me to see thy lord, who long’st
(O, let me _bate!) but not like me, yet long’st,
But in a fainter kind. O, not like me,
For mine_s beyond beyond: say, and speak thick,
(Love_s counsellor should fill the bores of hearing
To th_ smothering of the sense) how far it is
To this same blessed Milford. And by th_ way
Tell me how Wales was made so happy as
T_ inherit such a haven. But first of all,
How we may steal from hence; and for the gap
That we shall make in time from our hence-going
And our return, to excuse. But first, how get hence.
Why should excuse be born or ere begot?
We_ll talk of that hereafter. Prithee speak,
How many score of miles may we well rid
_Twixt hour and hour?

PISANIO.
One score _twixt sun and sun,
Madam, _s enough for you, and too much too.

IMOGEN.
Why, one that rode to_s execution, man,
Could never go so slow. I have heard of riding wagers
Where horses have been nimbler than the sands
That run i_ th’ clock’s behalf. But this is fool’ry.
Go bid my woman feign a sickness; say
She_ll home to her father; and provide me presently
A riding suit, no costlier than would fit
A franklin_s huswife.

PISANIO.
Madam, you_re best consider.

IMOGEN.
I see before me, man. Nor here, nor here,
Nor what ensues, but have a fog in them
That I cannot look through. Away, I prithee;
Do as I bid thee. There_s no more to say.
Accessible is none but Milford way.

 [_Exeunt._]

SCENE III. Wales. A mountainous country with a cave.

 Enter from the cave Belarius, Guiderius and Arviragus.

BELARIUS.
A goodly day not to keep house with such
Whose roof_s as low as ours! Stoop, boys; this gate
Instructs you how t_ adore the heavens, and bows you
To a morning_s holy office. The gates of monarchs
Are arch_d so high that giants may jet through
And keep their impious turbans on without
Good morrow to the sun. Hail, thou fair heaven!
We house i_ th’ rock, yet use thee not so hardly
As prouder livers do.

GUIDERIUS.
Hail, heaven!

ARVIRAGUS.
Hail, heaven!

BELARIUS.
Now for our mountain sport. Up to yond hill,
Your legs are young; I_ll tread these flats. Consider,
When you above perceive me like a crow,
That it is place which lessens and sets off;
And you may then revolve what tales I have told you
Of courts, of princes, of the tricks in war.
This service is not service so being done,
But being so allow_d. To apprehend thus
Draws us a profit from all things we see,
And often to our comfort shall we find
The sharded beetle in a safer hold
Than is the full-wing_d eagle. O, this life
Is nobler than attending for a check,
Richer than doing nothing for a robe,
Prouder than rustling in unpaid-for silk:
Such gain the cap of him that makes him fine,
Yet keeps his book uncross_d. No life to ours!

GUIDERIUS.
Out of your proof you speak. We, poor unfledg_d,
Have never wing_d from view o’ th’ nest, nor know not
What air_s from home. Haply this life is best,
If quiet life be best; sweeter to you
That have a sharper known; well corresponding
With your stiff age. But unto us it is
A cell of ignorance, travelling abed,
A prison for a debtor that not dares
To stride a limit.

ARVIRAGUS.
What should we speak of
When we are old as you? When we shall hear
The rain and wind beat dark December, how,
In this our pinching cave, shall we discourse.
The freezing hours away? We have seen nothing;
We are beastly: subtle as the fox for prey,
Like warlike as the wolf for what we eat.
Our valour is to chase what flies; our cage
We make a choir, as doth the prison_d bird,
And sing our bondage freely.

BELARIUS.
How you speak!
Did you but know the city_s usuries,
And felt them knowingly; the art o_ th’ court,
As hard to leave as keep, whose top to climb
Is certain falling, or so slipp_ry that
The fear_s as bad as falling; the toil o’ th’ war,
A pain that only seems to seek out danger
I_ th’ name of fame and honour, which dies i’ th’ search,
And hath as oft a sland_rous epitaph
As record of fair act; nay, many times,
Doth ill deserve by doing well; what_s worse,
Must curtsy at the censure. O, boys, this story
The world may read in me; my body_s mark’d
With Roman swords, and my report was once
First with the best of note. Cymbeline lov_d me;
And when a soldier was the theme, my name
Was not far off. Then was I as a tree
Whose boughs did bend with fruit. But in one night
A storm, or robbery, call it what you will,
Shook down my mellow hangings, nay, my leaves,
And left me bare to weather.

GUIDERIUS.
Uncertain favour!

BELARIUS.
My fault being nothing, as I have told you oft,
But that two villains, whose false oaths prevail_d
Before my perfect honour, swore to Cymbeline
I was confederate with the Romans. So
Follow_d my banishment, and this twenty years
This rock and these demesnes have been my world,
Where I have liv_d at honest freedom, paid
More pious debts to heaven than in all
The fore-end of my time. But up to th_ mountains!
This is not hunters_ language. He that strikes
The venison first shall be the lord o_ th’ feast;
To him the other two shall minister;
And we will fear no poison, which attends
In place of greater state. I_ll meet you in the valleys.

 [_Exeunt Guiderius and Arviragus._]

How hard it is to hide the sparks of nature!
These boys know little they are sons to th_ King,
Nor Cymbeline dreams that they are alive.
They think they are mine; and though train_d up thus meanly
I_ th’ cave wherein they bow, their thoughts do hit
The roofs of palaces, and nature prompts them
In simple and low things to prince it much
Beyond the trick of others. This Polydore,
The heir of Cymbeline and Britain, who
The King his father call_d Guiderius—Jove!
When on my three-foot stool I sit and tell
The warlike feats I have done, his spirits fly out
Into my story; say ‘Thus mine enemy fell,
And thus I set my foot on_s neck’; even then
The princely blood flows in his cheek, he sweats,
Strains his young nerves, and puts himself in posture
That acts my words. The younger brother, Cadwal,
Once Arviragus, in as like a figure
Strikes life into my speech, and shows much more
His own conceiving. Hark, the game is rous_d!
O Cymbeline, heaven and my conscience knows
Thou didst unjustly banish me! Whereon,
At three and two years old, I stole these babes,
Thinking to bar thee of succession as
Thou refts me of my lands. Euriphile,
Thou wast their nurse; they took thee for their mother,
And every day do honour to her grave.
Myself, Belarius, that am Morgan call_d,
They take for natural father. The game is up.

 [_Exit._]

SCENE IV. Wales, near Milford Haven.

 Enter Pisanio and Imogen.

IMOGEN.
Thou told_st me, when we came from horse, the place
Was near at hand. Ne_er long’d my mother so
To see me first as I have now. Pisanio! Man!
Where is Posthumus? What is in thy mind
That makes thee stare thus? Wherefore breaks that sigh
From th_ inward of thee? One but painted thus
Would be interpreted a thing perplex_d
Beyond self-explication. Put thyself
Into a haviour of less fear, ere wildness
Vanquish my staider senses. What_s the matter?
Why tender_st thou that paper to me with
A look untender? If_t be summer news,
Smile to_t before; if winterly, thou need’st
But keep that count_nance still. My husband’s hand?
That drug-damn_d Italy hath out-craftied him,
And he_s at some hard point. Speak, man; thy tongue
May take off some extremity, which to read
Would be even mortal to me.

PISANIO.
Please you read,
And you shall find me, wretched man, a thing
The most disdain_d of fortune.

IMOGEN.
[_Reads._] _Thy mistress, Pisanio, hath play_d the strumpet in my bed,
the testimonies whereof lie bleeding in me. I speak not out of weak
surmises, but from proof as strong as my grief and as certain as I
expect my revenge. That part thou, Pisanio, must act for me, if thy
faith be not tainted with the breach of hers. Let thine own hands take
away her life; I shall give thee opportunity at Milford Haven; she hath
my letter for the purpose; where, if thou fear to strike, and to make
me certain it is done, thou art the pandar to her dishonour, and
equally to me disloyal._

PISANIO.
What shall I need to draw my sword? The paper
Hath cut her throat already. No, _tis slander,
Whose edge is sharper than the sword, whose tongue
Outvenoms all the worms of Nile, whose breath
Rides on the posting winds and doth belie
All corners of the world. Kings, queens, and states,
Maids, matrons, nay, the secrets of the grave,
This viperous slander enters. What cheer, madam?

IMOGEN.
False to his bed? What is it to be false?
To lie in watch there, and to think on him?
To weep twixt clock and clock? If sleep charge nature,
To break it with a fearful dream of him,
And cry myself awake? That_s false to’s bed,
Is it?

PISANIO.
Alas, good lady!

IMOGEN.
I false! Thy conscience witness! Iachimo,
Thou didst accuse him of incontinency;
Thou then look_dst like a villain; now, methinks,
Thy favour_s good enough. Some jay of Italy,
Whose mother was her painting, hath betray_d him.
Poor I am stale, a garment out of fashion,
And for I am richer than to hang by th_ walls
I must be ripp_d. To pieces with me! O,
Men_s vows are women’s traitors! All good seeming,
By thy revolt, O husband, shall be thought
Put on for villainy; not born where_t grows,
But worn a bait for ladies.

PISANIO.
Good madam, hear me.

IMOGEN.
True honest men being heard, like false Æneas,
Were, in his time, thought false; and Sinon_s weeping
Did scandal many a holy tear, took pity
