Where is she, sir? How
Can her contempt be answer_d?

ATTENDANT.
Please you, sir,
Her chambers are all lock_d, and there’s no answer
That will be given to th_ loud of noise we make.

QUEEN.
My lord, when last I went to visit her,
She pray_d me to excuse her keeping close;
Whereto constrain_d by her infirmity
She should that duty leave unpaid to you
Which daily she was bound to proffer. This
She wish_d me to make known; but our great court
Made me to blame in memory.

CYMBELINE.
Her doors lock_d?
Not seen of late? Grant, heavens, that which I fear
Prove false!

 [_Exit._]

QUEEN.
Son, I say, follow the King.

CLOTEN.
That man of hers, Pisanio, her old servant,
I have not seen these two days.

QUEEN.
Go, look after.

 [_Exit Cloten._]

Pisanio, thou that stand_st so for Posthumus!
He hath a drug of mine. I pray his absence
Proceed by swallowing that; for he believes
It is a thing most precious. But for her,
Where is she gone? Haply despair hath seiz_d her;
Or, wing_d with fervour of her love, she’s flown
To her desir_d Posthumus. Gone she is
To death or to dishonour, and my end
Can make good use of either. She being down,
I have the placing of the British crown.

 Enter Cloten.

How now, my son?

CLOTEN.
_Tis certain she is fled.
Go in and cheer the King. He rages; none
Dare come about him.

QUEEN.
All the better. May
This night forestall him of the coming day!

 [_Exit._]

CLOTEN.
I love and hate her; for she_s fair and royal,
And that she hath all courtly parts more exquisite
Than lady, ladies, woman. From every one
The best she hath, and she, of all compounded,
Outsells them all. I love her therefore; but
Disdaining me and throwing favours on
The low Posthumus slanders so her judgement
That what_s else rare is chok’d; and in that point
I will conclude to hate her, nay, indeed,
To be reveng_d upon her. For when fools
Shall—

 Enter Pisanio.

Who is here? What, are you packing, sirrah?
Come hither. Ah, you precious pandar! Villain,
Where is thy lady? In a word, or else
Thou art straightway with the fiends.

PISANIO.
O good my lord!

CLOTEN.
Where is thy lady? or, by Jupiter—
I will not ask again. Close villain,
I_ll have this secret from thy heart, or rip
Thy heart to find it. Is she with Posthumus?
From whose so many weights of baseness cannot
A dram of worth be drawn.

PISANIO.
Alas, my lord,
How can she be with him? When was she miss_d?
He is in Rome.

CLOTEN.
Where is she, sir? Come nearer.
No farther halting! Satisfy me home
What is become of her.

PISANIO.
O my all-worthy lord!

CLOTEN.
All-worthy villain!
Discover where thy mistress is at once,
At the next word. No more of ‘worthy lord_!
Speak, or thy silence on the instant is
Thy condemnation and thy death.

PISANIO.
Then, sir,
This paper is the history of my knowledge
Touching her flight.

 [_Presenting a letter._]

CLOTEN.
Let_s see’t. I will pursue her
Even to Augustus_ throne.

PISANIO.
[_Aside._] Or this or perish.
She_s far enough; and what he learns by this
May prove his travel, not her danger.

CLOTEN.
Humh!

PISANIO.
[_Aside._] I_ll write to my lord she’s dead. O Imogen,
Safe mayst thou wander, safe return again!

CLOTEN.
Sirrah, is this letter true?

PISANIO.
Sir, as I think.

CLOTEN.
It is Posthumus_ hand; I know’t. Sirrah, if thou wouldst not be a
villain, but do me true service, undergo those employments wherein I
should have cause to use thee with a serious industry—that is, what
villainy soe_er I bid thee do, to perform it directly and truly—I would
think thee an honest man; thou shouldst neither want my means for thy
relief nor my voice for thy preferment.

PISANIO.
Well, my good lord.

CLOTEN.
Wilt thou serve me? For since patiently and constantly thou hast stuck
to the bare fortune of that beggar Posthumus, thou canst not, in the
course of gratitude, but be a diligent follower of mine. Wilt thou
serve me?

PISANIO.
Sir, I will.

CLOTEN.
Give me thy hand; here_s my purse. Hast any of thy late master’s
garments in thy possession?

PISANIO.
I have, my lord, at my lodging, the same suit he wore when he took
leave of my lady and mistress.

CLOTEN.
The first service thou dost me, fetch that suit hither. Let it be thy
first service; go.

PISANIO.
I shall, my lord.

 [_Exit._]

CLOTEN.
Meet thee at Milford Haven! I forgot to ask him one thing; I_ll
remember_t anon. Even there, thou villain Posthumus, will I kill thee.
I would these garments were come. She said upon a time—the bitterness
of it I now belch from my heart—that she held the very garment of
Posthumus in more respect than my noble and natural person, together
with the adornment of my qualities. With that suit upon my back will I
ravish her; first kill him, and in her eyes. There shall she see my
valour, which will then be a torment to her contempt. He on the ground,
my speech of insultment ended on his dead body, and when my lust hath
dined—which, as I say, to vex her I will execute in the clothes that
she so prais_d—to the court I’ll knock her back, foot her home again.
She hath despis_d me rejoicingly, and I’ll be merry in my revenge.

 Enter Pisanio with the clothes.

Be those the garments?

PISANIO.
Ay, my noble lord.

CLOTEN.
How long is_t since she went to Milford Haven?

PISANIO.
She can scarce be there yet.

CLOTEN.
Bring this apparel to my chamber; that is the second thing that I have
commanded thee. The third is that thou wilt be a voluntary mute to my
design. Be but duteous and true, preferment shall tender itself to
thee. My revenge is now at Milford, would I had wings to follow it!
Come, and be true.

 [_Exit._]

PISANIO.
Thou bid_st me to my loss; for true to thee
Were to prove false, which I will never be,
To him that is most true. To Milford go,
And find not her whom thou pursuest. Flow, flow,
You heavenly blessings, on her! This fool_s speed
Be cross_d with slowness! Labour be his meed!

 [_Exit._]

SCENE VI. Wales. Before the cave of Belarius.

 Enter Imogen alone, in boy_s clothes.

IMOGEN.
I see a man_s life is a tedious one.
I have tir_d myself, and for two nights together
Have made the ground my bed. I should be sick
But that my resolution helps me. Milford,
When from the mountain-top Pisanio show_d thee,
Thou wast within a ken. O Jove! I think
Foundations fly the wretched; such, I mean,
Where they should be reliev_d. Two beggars told me
I could not miss my way. Will poor folks lie,
That have afflictions on them, knowing _tis
A punishment or trial? Yes; no wonder,
When rich ones scarce tell true. To lapse in fulness
Is sorer than to lie for need; and falsehood
Is worse in kings than beggars. My dear lord!
Thou art one o_ th’ false ones. Now I think on thee
My hunger_s gone; but even before, I was
At point to sink for food. But what is this?
Here is a path to_t; ’tis some savage hold.
I were best not call; I dare not call. Yet famine,
Ere clean it o_erthrow nature, makes it valiant.
Plenty and peace breeds cowards; hardness ever
Of hardiness is mother. Ho! who_s here?
If anything that_s civil, speak; if savage,
Take or lend. Ho! No answer? Then I_ll enter.
Best draw my sword; and if mine enemy
But fear the sword, like me, he_ll scarcely look on’t.
Such a foe, good heavens!

 [_Exit into the cave._]

SCENE VII. The same.

 Enter Belarius, Guiderius and Arviragus.

BELARIUS.
You, Polydore, have prov_d best woodman and
Are master of the feast. Cadwal and I
Will play the cook and servant; _tis our match.
The sweat of industry would dry and die
But for the end it works to. Come, our stomachs
Will make what_s homely savoury; weariness
Can snore upon the flint, when resty sloth
Finds the down pillow hard. Now, peace be here,
Poor house, that keep_st thyself!

GUIDERIUS.
I am thoroughly weary.

ARVIRAGUS.
I am weak with toil, yet strong in appetite.

GUIDERIUS.
There is cold meat i_ th’ cave; we’ll browse on that
Whilst what we have kill_d be cook’d.

BELARIUS.
[_Looking into the cave._] Stay, come not in.
But that it eats our victuals, I should think
Here were a fairy.

GUIDERIUS.
What_s the matter, sir?

BELARIUS.
By Jupiter, an angel! or, if not,
An earthly paragon! Behold divineness
No elder than a boy!

 Enter Imogen.
