The smile mocking the sigh that it would fly
From so divine a temple to commix
With winds that sailors rail at.

GUIDERIUS.
I do note
That grief and patience, rooted in him both,
Mingle their spurs together.

ARVIRAGUS.
Grow patience!
And let the stinking elder, grief, untwine
His perishing root with the increasing vine!

BELARIUS.
It is great morning. Come, away! Who_s there?

 Enter Cloten.

CLOTEN.
I cannot find those runagates; that villain
Hath mock_d me. I am faint.

BELARIUS.
Those runagates?
Means he not us? I partly know him; _tis
Cloten, the son o_ th’ Queen. I fear some ambush.
I saw him not these many years, and yet
I know _tis he. We are held as outlaws. Hence!

GUIDERIUS.
He is but one; you and my brother search
What companies are near. Pray you away;
Let me alone with him.

 [_Exeunt Belarius and Arviragus._]

CLOTEN.
Soft! What are you
That fly me thus? Some villain mountaineers?
I have heard of such. What slave art thou?

GUIDERIUS.
A thing
More slavish did I ne_er than answering
A slave without a knock.

CLOTEN.
Thou art a robber,
A law-breaker, a villain. Yield thee, thief.

GUIDERIUS.
To who? To thee? What art thou? Have not I
An arm as big as thine, a heart as big?
Thy words, I grant, are bigger, for I wear not
My dagger in my mouth. Say what thou art;
Why I should yield to thee.

CLOTEN.
Thou villain base,
Know_st me not by my clothes?

GUIDERIUS.
No, nor thy tailor, rascal,
Who is thy grandfather; he made those clothes,
Which, as it seems, make thee.

CLOTEN.
Thou precious varlet,
My tailor made them not.

GUIDERIUS.
Hence, then, and thank
The man that gave them thee. Thou art some fool;
I am loath to beat thee.

CLOTEN.
Thou injurious thief,
Hear but my name, and tremble.

GUIDERIUS.
What_s thy name?

CLOTEN.
Cloten, thou villain.

GUIDERIUS.
Cloten, thou double villain, be thy name,
I cannot tremble at it. Were it Toad, or Adder, Spider,
_Twould move me sooner.

CLOTEN.
To thy further fear,
Nay, to thy mere confusion, thou shalt know
I am son to th_ Queen.

GUIDERIUS.
I_m sorry for’t; not seeming
So worthy as thy birth.

CLOTEN.
Art not afeard?

GUIDERIUS.
Those that I reverence, those I fear—the wise;
At fools I laugh, not fear them.

CLOTEN.
Die the death.
When I have slain thee with my proper hand,
I_ll follow those that even now fled hence,
And on the gates of Lud_s Town set your heads.
Yield, rustic mountaineer.

 [_Exeunt, fighting._]

 Enter Belarius and Arviragus.

BELARIUS.
No company_s abroad?

ARVIRAGUS.
None in the world; you did mistake him, sure.

BELARIUS.
I cannot tell; long is it since I saw him,
But time hath nothing blurr_d those lines of favour
Which then he wore; the snatches in his voice,
And burst of speaking, were as his. I am absolute
_Twas very Cloten.

ARVIRAGUS.
In this place we left them.
I wish my brother make good time with him,
You say he is so fell.

BELARIUS.
Being scarce made up,
I mean to man, he had not apprehension
Or roaring terrors; for defect of judgement
Is oft the cease of fear.

 Enter Guiderius with Cloten_s head.

But, see, thy brother.

GUIDERIUS.
This Cloten was a fool, an empty purse;
There was no money in_t. Not Hercules
Could have knock_d out his brains, for he had none;
Yet I not doing this, the fool had borne
My head as I do his.

BELARIUS.
What hast thou done?

GUIDERIUS.
I am perfect what: cut off one Cloten_s head,
Son to the Queen, after his own report;
Who call_d me traitor, mountaineer, and swore
With his own single hand he_d take us in,
Displace our heads where, thank the gods, they grow,
And set them on Lud_s Town.

BELARIUS.
We are all undone.

GUIDERIUS.
Why, worthy father, what have we to lose
But that he swore to take, our lives? The law
Protects not us; then why should we be tender
To let an arrogant piece of flesh threat us,
Play judge and executioner all himself,
For we do fear the law? What company
Discover you abroad?

BELARIUS.
No single soul
Can we set eye on, but in all safe reason
He must have some attendants. Though his humour
Was nothing but mutation, ay, and that
From one bad thing to worse, not frenzy, not
Absolute madness could so far have rav_d,
To bring him here alone. Although perhaps
It may be heard at court that such as we
Cave here, hunt here, are outlaws, and in time
May make some stronger head, the which he hearing,
As it is like him, might break out and swear
He_d fetch us in; yet is’t not probable
To come alone, either he so undertaking
Or they so suffering. Then on good ground we fear,
If we do fear this body hath a tail
More perilous than the head.

ARVIRAGUS.
Let ordinance
Come as the gods foresay it. Howsoe_er,
My brother hath done well.

BELARIUS.
I had no mind
To hunt this day; the boy Fidele_s sickness
Did make my way long forth.

GUIDERIUS.
With his own sword,
Which he did wave against my throat, I have ta_en
His head from him. I_ll throw’t into the creek
Behind our rock, and let it to the sea
And tell the fishes he_s the Queen’s son, Cloten.
That_s all I reck.

 [_Exit._]

BELARIUS.
I fear _twill be reveng’d.
Would, Polydore, thou hadst not done_t! though valour
Becomes thee well enough.

ARVIRAGUS.
Would I had done_t,
So the revenge alone pursu_d me! Polydore,
I love thee brotherly, but envy much
Thou hast robb_d me of this deed. I would revenges,
That possible strength might meet, would seek us through,
And put us to our answer.

BELARIUS.
Well, _tis done.
We_ll hunt no more today, nor seek for danger
Where there_s no profit. I prithee to our rock.
You and Fidele play the cooks; I_ll stay
Till hasty Polydore return, and bring him
To dinner presently.

ARVIRAGUS.
Poor sick Fidele!
I_ll willingly to him; to gain his colour
I_d let a parish of such Cloten’s blood,
And praise myself for charity.

 [_Exit._]

BELARIUS.
O thou goddess,
Thou divine Nature, thou thyself thou blazon_st
In these two princely boys! They are as gentle
As zephyrs blowing below the violet,
Not wagging his sweet head; and yet as rough,
Their royal blood enchaf_d, as the rud’st wind
That by the top doth take the mountain pine
And make him stoop to th_ vale. ’Tis wonder
That an invisible instinct should frame them
To royalty unlearn_d, honour untaught,
Civility not seen from other, valour
That wildly grows in them, but yields a crop
As if it had been sow_d. Yet still it’s strange
What Cloten_s being here to us portends,
Or what his death will bring us.

 Enter Guiderius.

GUIDERIUS.
Where_s my brother?
I have sent Cloten_s clotpoll down the stream,
In embassy to his mother; his body_s hostage
For his return.

 [_Solemn music._]

BELARIUS.
My ingenious instrument!
Hark, Polydore, it sounds. But what occasion
Hath Cadwal now to give it motion? Hark!

GUIDERIUS.
Is he at home?

BELARIUS.
He went hence even now.

GUIDERIUS.
What does he mean? Since death of my dear_st mother
It did not speak before. All solemn things
Should answer solemn accidents. The matter?
Triumphs for nothing and lamenting toys
Is jollity for apes and grief for boys.
Is Cadwal mad?

 Enter Arviragus with Imogen as dead, bearing her in his arms.

BELARIUS.
Look, here he comes,
And brings the dire occasion in his arms
Of what we blame him for!

ARVIRAGUS.
The bird is dead
That we have made so much on. I had rather
Have skipp_d from sixteen years of age to sixty,
