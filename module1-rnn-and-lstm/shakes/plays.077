To have turn_d my leaping time into a crutch,
Than have seen this.

GUIDERIUS.
O sweetest, fairest lily!
My brother wears thee not the one half so well
As when thou grew_st thyself.

BELARIUS.
O melancholy!
Who ever yet could sound thy bottom? find
The ooze to show what coast thy sluggish crare
Might_st easiliest harbour in? Thou blessed thing!
Jove knows what man thou mightst have made; but I,
Thou diedst, a most rare boy, of melancholy.
How found you him?

ARVIRAGUS.
Stark, as you see;
Thus smiling, as some fly had tickled slumber,
Not as death_s dart, being laugh’d at; his right cheek
Reposing on a cushion.

GUIDERIUS.
Where?

ARVIRAGUS.
O_ th’ floor;
His arms thus leagu_d. I thought he slept, and put
My clouted brogues from off my feet, whose rudeness
Answer_d my steps too loud.

GUIDERIUS.
Why, he but sleeps.
If he be gone he_ll make his grave a bed;
With female fairies will his tomb be haunted,
And worms will not come to thee.

ARVIRAGUS.
With fairest flowers,
Whilst summer lasts and I live here, Fidele,
I_ll sweeten thy sad grave. Thou shalt not lack
The flower that_s like thy face, pale primrose; nor
The azur_d hare-bell, like thy veins; no, nor
The leaf of eglantine, whom not to slander,
Out-sweet_ned not thy breath. The ruddock would,
With charitable bill (O bill, sore shaming
Those rich-left heirs that let their fathers lie
Without a monument!) bring thee all this;
Yea, and furr_d moss besides, when flow’rs are none,
To winter-ground thy corse—

GUIDERIUS.
Prithee have done,
And do not play in wench-like words with that
Which is so serious. Let us bury him,
And not protract with admiration what
Is now due debt. To th_ grave.

ARVIRAGUS.
Say, where shall_s lay him?

GUIDERIUS.
By good Euriphile, our mother.

ARVIRAGUS.
Be_t so;
And let us, Polydore, though now our voices
Have got the mannish crack, sing him to th_ ground,
As once to our mother; use like note and words,
Save that Euriphile must be Fidele.

GUIDERIUS.
Cadwal,
I cannot sing. I_ll weep, and word it with thee;
For notes of sorrow out of tune are worse
Than priests and fanes that lie.

ARVIRAGUS.
We_ll speak it, then.

BELARIUS.
Great griefs, I see, med_cine the less, for Cloten
Is quite forgot. He was a queen_s son, boys;
And though he came our enemy, remember
He was paid for that. Though mean and mighty rotting
Together have one dust, yet reverence,
That angel of the world, doth make distinction
Of place _tween high and low. Our foe was princely;
And though you took his life, as being our foe,
Yet bury him as a prince.

GUIDERIUS.
Pray you fetch him hither.
Thersites_ body is as good as Ajax’,
When neither are alive.

ARVIRAGUS.
If you_ll go fetch him,
We_ll say our song the whilst. Brother, begin.

 [_Exit Belarius._]

GUIDERIUS.
Nay, Cadwal, we must lay his head to th_ East;
My father hath a reason for_t.

ARVIRAGUS.
_Tis true.

GUIDERIUS.
Come on, then, and remove him.

ARVIRAGUS.
So. Begin.

SONG

GUIDERIUS.
_    Fear no more the heat o_ th’ sun,
        Nor the furious winter_s rages;
    Thou thy worldly task hast done,
        Home art gone, and ta_en thy wages.
    Golden lads and girls all must,
    As chimney-sweepers, come to dust._

ARVIRAGUS.
_    Fear no more the frown o_ th’ great;
        Thou art past the tyrant_s stroke.
    Care no more to clothe and eat;
        To thee the reed is as the oak.
    The sceptre, learning, physic, must
    All follow this and come to dust._

GUIDERIUS.
_    Fear no more the lightning flash._

ARVIRAGUS.
_        Nor th_ all-dreaded thunder-stone._

GUIDERIUS.
_    Fear not slander, censure rash;_

ARVIRAGUS.
_    Thou hast finish_d joy and moan._

BOTH.
_    All lovers young, all lovers must
    Consign to thee and come to dust._

GUIDERIUS.
_    No exorciser harm thee!_

ARVIRAGUS.
_    Nor no witchcraft charm thee!_

GUIDERIUS.
_    Ghost unlaid forbear thee!_

ARVIRAGUS.
_    Nothing ill come near thee!_

BOTH.
_    Quiet consummation have,
    And renowned be thy grave!_

 Enter Belarius with the body of Cloten.

GUIDERIUS.
We have done our obsequies. Come, lay him down.

BELARIUS.
Here_s a few flowers; but ’bout midnight, more.
The herbs that have on them cold dew o_ th’ night
Are strewings fit_st for graves. Upon their faces.
You were as flow_rs, now wither’d. Even so
These herblets shall which we upon you strew.
Come on, away. Apart upon our knees.
The ground that gave them first has them again.
Their pleasures here are past, so is their pain.

 [_Exeunt all but Imogen._]

IMOGEN.
[_Awaking._] Yes, sir, to Milford Haven. Which is the way?
I thank you. By yond bush? Pray, how far thither?
_Ods pittikins! can it be six mile yet?
I have gone all night. Faith, I_ll lie down and sleep.
But, soft! no bedfellow. O gods and goddesses!

 [_Seeing the body._]

These flow_rs are like the pleasures of the world;
This bloody man, the care on_t. I hope I dream;
For so I thought I was a cave-keeper,
And cook to honest creatures. But _tis not so;
_Twas but a bolt of nothing, shot at nothing,
Which the brain makes of fumes. Our very eyes
Are sometimes, like our judgements, blind. Good faith,
I tremble still with fear; but if there be
Yet left in heaven as small a drop of pity
As a wren_s eye, fear’d gods, a part of it!
The dream_s here still. Even when I wake it is
Without me, as within me; not imagin_d, felt.
A headless man? The garments of Posthumus?
I know the shape of_s leg; this is his hand,
His foot Mercurial, his Martial thigh,
The brawns of Hercules; but his Jovial face—
Murder in heaven! How! _Tis gone. Pisanio,
All curses madded Hecuba gave the Greeks,
And mine to boot, be darted on thee! Thou,
Conspir_d with that irregulous devil, Cloten,
Hath here cut off my lord. To write and read
Be henceforth treacherous! Damn_d Pisanio
Hath with his forged letters (damn_d Pisanio)
From this most bravest vessel of the world
Struck the main-top. O Posthumus! alas,
Where is thy head? Where_s that? Ay me! where’s that?
Pisanio might have kill_d thee at the heart,
And left this head on. How should this be? Pisanio?
_Tis he and Cloten; malice and lucre in them
Have laid this woe here. O, _tis pregnant, pregnant!
The drug he gave me, which he said was precious
And cordial to me, have I not found it
Murd_rous to th’ senses? That confirms it home.
This is Pisanio_s deed, and Cloten. O!
Give colour to my pale cheek with thy blood,
That we the horrider may seem to those
Which chance to find us. O, my lord, my lord!

 [_Falls fainting on the body._]

 Enter Lucius, Captains and a Soothsayer.

CAPTAIN.
To them the legions garrison_d in Gallia,
After your will, have cross_d the sea, attending
You here at Milford Haven; with your ships,
They are in readiness.

LUCIUS.
But what from Rome?

CAPTAIN.
The Senate hath stirr_d up the confiners
And gentlemen of Italy, most willing spirits,
That promise noble service; and they come
Under the conduct of bold Iachimo,
Sienna_s brother.

LUCIUS.
When expect you them?

CAPTAIN.
With the next benefit o_ th’ wind.

LUCIUS.
This forwardness
Makes our hopes fair. Command our present numbers
Be muster_d; bid the captains look to’t. Now, sir,
What have you dream_d of late of this war’s purpose?

SOOTHSAYER.
Last night the very gods show_d me a vision
(I fast and pray_d for their intelligence) thus:
I saw Jove_s bird, the Roman eagle, wing’d
From the spongy south to this part of the west,
There vanish_d in the sunbeams; which portends,
Unless my sins abuse my divination,
Success to th_ Roman host.

LUCIUS.
Dream often so,
And never false. Soft, ho! what trunk is here
Without his top? The ruin speaks that sometime
It was a worthy building. How? a page?
Or dead or sleeping on him? But dead, rather;
For nature doth abhor to make his bed
With the defunct, or sleep upon the dead.
Let_s see the boy’s face.

CAPTAIN.
He_s alive, my lord.

LUCIUS.
He_ll then instruct us of this body. Young one,
Inform us of thy fortunes; for it seems
They crave to be demanded. Who is this
Thou mak_st thy bloody pillow? Or who was he
That, otherwise than noble nature did,
Hath alter_d that good picture? What’s thy interest
In this sad wreck? How came_t? Who is’t?
What art thou?

IMOGEN.
I am nothing; or if not,
Nothing to be were better. This was my master,
A very valiant Briton and a good,
That here by mountaineers lies slain. Alas!
There is no more such masters. I may wander
