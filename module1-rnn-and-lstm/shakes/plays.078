From east to occident; cry out for service;
Try many, all good; serve truly; never
Find such another master.

LUCIUS.
_Lack, good youth!
Thou mov_st no less with thy complaining than
Thy master in bleeding. Say his name, good friend.

IMOGEN.
Richard du Champ. [_Aside._] If I do lie, and do
No harm by it, though the gods hear, I hope
They_ll pardon it.—Say you, sir?

LUCIUS.
Thy name?

IMOGEN.
Fidele, sir.

LUCIUS.
Thou dost approve thyself the very same;
Thy name well fits thy faith, thy faith thy name.
Wilt take thy chance with me? I will not say
Thou shalt be so well master_d; but, be sure,
No less belov_d. The Roman Emperor’s letters,
Sent by a consul to me, should not sooner
Than thine own worth prefer thee. Go with me.

IMOGEN.
I_ll follow, sir. But first, an’t please the gods,
I_ll hide my master from the flies, as deep
As these poor pickaxes can dig; and when
With wild wood-leaves and weeds I ha_ strew’d his grave,
And on it said a century of prayers,
Such as I can, twice o_er, I’ll weep and sigh;
And leaving so his service, follow you,
So please you entertain me.

LUCIUS.
Ay, good youth;
And rather father thee than master thee.
My friends,
The boy hath taught us manly duties; let us
Find out the prettiest daisied plot we can,
And make him with our pikes and partisans
A grave. Come, arm him. Boy, he is preferr_d
By thee to us; and he shall be interr_d
As soldiers can. Be cheerful; wipe thine eyes.
Some falls are means the happier to arise.

 [_Exeunt._]

SCENE III. Britain. Cymbeline_s palace.

 Enter Cymbeline, Lords, Pisanio and Attendants.

CYMBELINE.
Again! and bring me word how _tis with her.

 [_Exit an Attendant._]

A fever with the absence of her son;
A madness, of which her life_s in danger. Heavens,
How deeply you at once do touch me! Imogen,
The great part of my comfort, gone; my queen
Upon a desperate bed, and in a time
When fearful wars point at me; her son gone,
So needful for this present. It strikes me past
The hope of comfort. But for thee, fellow,
Who needs must know of her departure and
Dost seem so ignorant, we_ll enforce it from thee
By a sharp torture.

PISANIO.
Sir, my life is yours;
I humbly set it at your will; but for my mistress,
I nothing know where she remains, why gone,
Nor when she purposes return. Beseech your Highness,
Hold me your loyal servant.

LORD.
Good my liege,
The day that she was missing he was here.
I dare be bound he_s true and shall perform
All parts of his subjection loyally. For Cloten,
There wants no diligence in seeking him,
And will no doubt be found.

CYMBELINE.
The time is troublesome.
[_To Pisanio._] We_ll slip you for a season; but our jealousy
Does yet depend.

LORD.
So please your Majesty,
The Roman legions, all from Gallia drawn,
Are landed on your coast, with a supply
Of Roman gentlemen by the Senate sent.

CYMBELINE.
Now for the counsel of my son and queen!
I am amaz_d with matter.

LORD.
Good my liege,
Your preparation can affront no less
Than what you hear of. Come more, for more you_re ready.
The want is but to put those pow_rs in motion
That long to move.

CYMBELINE.
I thank you. Let_s withdraw,
And meet the time as it seeks us. We fear not
What can from Italy annoy us; but
We grieve at chances here. Away!

 [_Exeunt all but Pisanio._]

PISANIO.
I heard no letter from my master since
I wrote him Imogen was slain. _Tis strange.
Nor hear I from my mistress, who did promise
To yield me often tidings. Neither know I
What is betid to Cloten, but remain
Perplex_d in all. The heavens still must work.
Wherein I am false I am honest; not true, to be true.
These present wars shall find I love my country,
Even to the note o_ th’ King, or I’ll fall in them.
All other doubts, by time let them be clear_d:
Fortune brings in some boats that are not steer_d.

 [_Exit._]

SCENE IV. Wales. Before the cave of Belarius.

 Enter Belarius, Guiderius and Arviragus.

GUIDERIUS.
The noise is round about us.

BELARIUS.
Let us from it.

ARVIRAGUS.
What pleasure, sir, find we in life, to lock it
From action and adventure?

GUIDERIUS.
Nay, what hope
Have we in hiding us? This way the Romans
Must or for Britons slay us, or receive us
For barbarous and unnatural revolts
During their use, and slay us after.

BELARIUS.
Sons,
We_ll higher to the mountains; there secure us.
To the King_s party there’s no going. Newness
Of Cloten_s death (we being not known, not muster’d
Among the bands) may drive us to a render
Where we have liv_d, and so extort from’s that
Which we have done, whose answer would be death,
Drawn on with torture.

GUIDERIUS.
This is, sir, a doubt
In such a time nothing becoming you
Nor satisfying us.

ARVIRAGUS.
It is not likely
That when they hear the Roman horses neigh,
Behold their quarter_d fires, have both their eyes
And ears so cloy_d importantly as now,
That they will waste their time upon our note,
To know from whence we are.

BELARIUS.
O, I am known
Of many in the army. Many years,
Though Cloten then but young, you see, not wore him
From my remembrance. And, besides, the King
Hath not deserv_d my service nor your loves,
Who find in my exile the want of breeding,
The certainty of this hard life; aye hopeless
To have the courtesy your cradle promis_d,
But to be still hot summer_s tanlings and
The shrinking slaves of winter.

GUIDERIUS.
Than be so,
Better to cease to be. Pray, sir, to th_ army.
I and my brother are not known; yourself
So out of thought, and thereto so o_ergrown,
Cannot be questioned.

ARVIRAGUS.
By this sun that shines,
I_ll thither. What thing is’t that I never
Did see man die! scarce ever look_d on blood
But that of coward hares, hot goats, and venison!
Never bestrid a horse, save one that had
A rider like myself, who ne_er wore rowel
Nor iron on his heel! I am asham_d
To look upon the holy sun, to have
The benefit of his blest beams, remaining
So long a poor unknown.

GUIDERIUS.
By heavens, I_ll go!
If you will bless me, sir, and give me leave,
I_ll take the better care; but if you will not,
The hazard therefore due fall on me by
The hands of Romans!

ARVIRAGUS.
So say I. Amen.

BELARIUS.
No reason I, since of your lives you set
So slight a valuation, should reserve
My crack_d one to more care. Have with you, boys!
If in your country wars you chance to die,
That is my bed too, lads, and there I_ll lie.
Lead, lead. [_Aside._] The time seems long; their blood thinks scorn
Till it fly out and show them princes born.

 [_Exeunt._]



ACT V

SCENE I. Britain. The Roman camp.

 Enter Posthumus alone, with a bloody handkerchief.

POSTHUMUS.
Yea, bloody cloth, I_ll keep thee; for I wish’d
Thou shouldst be colour_d thus. You married ones,
If each of you should take this course, how many
Must murder wives much better than themselves
For wrying but a little! O Pisanio!
Every good servant does not all commands;
No bond but to do just ones. Gods! if you
Should have ta_en vengeance on my faults, I never
Had liv_d to put on this; so had you saved
The noble Imogen to repent, and struck
Me, wretch more worth your vengeance. But alack,
You snatch some hence for little faults; that_s love,
To have them fall no more. You some permit
To second ills with ills, each elder worse,
And make them dread it, to the doers_ thrift.
But Imogen is your own. Do your best wills,
And make me blest to obey. I am brought hither
Among th_ Italian gentry, and to fight
Against my lady_s kingdom. ’Tis enough
That, Britain, I have kill_d thy mistress; peace!
I_ll give no wound to thee. Therefore, good heavens,
Hear patiently my purpose. I_ll disrobe me
Of these Italian weeds, and suit myself
As does a Britain peasant. So I_ll fight
Against the part I come with; so I_ll die
For thee, O Imogen, even for whom my life
Is every breath a death. And thus unknown,
Pitied nor hated, to the face of peril
Myself I_ll dedicate. Let me make men know
More valour in me than my habits show.
Gods, put the strength o_ th’ Leonati in me!
To shame the guise o_ th’ world, I will begin
The fashion less without and more within.

 [_Exit._]

SCENE II. Britain. A field of battle between the British and Roman
camps.

 Enter Lucius, Iachimo and the Roman army at one door, and the British
 army at another, Leonatus Posthumus following like a poor soldier.
 They march over and go out. Alarums. Then enter again, in skirmish,
 Iachimo and Posthumus. He vanquisheth and disarmeth Iachimo and then
 leaves him.

IACHIMO.
The heaviness and guilt within my bosom
Takes off my manhood. I have belied a lady,
The Princess of this country, and the air on_t
Revengingly enfeebles me; or could this carl,
A very drudge of nature_s, have subdu’d me
In my profession? Knighthoods and honours borne
As I wear mine are titles but of scorn.
If that thy gentry, Britain, go before
This lout as he exceeds our lords, the odds
Is that we scarce are men, and you are gods.

 [_Exit._]

 The battle continues; the Britons fly; Cymbeline is taken. Then enter
 to his rescue Belarius, Guiderius and Arviragus.
