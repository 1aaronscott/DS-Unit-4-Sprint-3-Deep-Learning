Lady,
The gods throw stones of sulphur on me, if
That box I gave you was not thought by me
A precious thing! I had it from the Queen.

CYMBELINE.
New matter still?

IMOGEN.
It poison_d me.

CORNELIUS.
O gods!
I left out one thing which the Queen confess_d,
Which must approve thee honest. ‘If Pisanio
Have_ said she ‘given his mistress that confection
Which I gave him for cordial, she is serv_d
As I would serve a rat._

CYMBELINE.
What_s this, Cornelius?

CORNELIUS.
The Queen, sir, very oft importun_d me
To temper poisons for her; still pretending
The satisfaction of her knowledge only
In killing creatures vile, as cats and dogs,
Of no esteem. I, dreading that her purpose
Was of more danger, did compound for her
A certain stuff, which, being ta_en would cease
The present pow_r of life, but in short time
All offices of nature should again
Do their due functions. Have you ta_en of it?

IMOGEN.
Most like I did, for I was dead.

BELARIUS.
My boys,
There was our error.

GUIDERIUS.
This is sure Fidele.

IMOGEN.
Why did you throw your wedded lady from you?
Think that you are upon a rock, and now
Throw me again.

 [_Embracing him._]

POSTHUMUS.
Hang there like fruit, my soul,
Till the tree die!

CYMBELINE.
How now, my flesh? my child?
What, mak_st thou me a dullard in this act?
Wilt thou not speak to me?

IMOGEN.
[_Kneeling._] Your blessing, sir.

BELARIUS.
[_To Guiderius and Arviragus._] Though you did love this youth, I blame
ye not;
You had a motive for_t.

CYMBELINE.
My tears that fall
Prove holy water on thee! Imogen,
Thy mother_s dead.

IMOGEN.
I am sorry for_t, my lord.

CYMBELINE.
O, she was naught, and long of her it was
That we meet here so strangely; but her son
Is gone, we know not how nor where.

PISANIO.
My lord,
Now fear is from me, I_ll speak troth. Lord Cloten,
Upon my lady_s missing, came to me
With his sword drawn, foam_d at the mouth, and swore,
If I discover_d not which way she was gone,
It was my instant death. By accident
I had a feigned letter of my master_s
Then in my pocket, which directed him
To seek her on the mountains near to Milford;
Where, in a frenzy, in my master_s garments,
Which he enforc_d from me, away he posts
With unchaste purpose, and with oath to violate
My lady_s honour. What became of him
I further know not.

GUIDERIUS.
Let me end the story:
I slew him there.

CYMBELINE.
Marry, the gods forfend!
I would not thy good deeds should from my lips
Pluck a hard sentence. Prithee, valiant youth,
Deny_t again.

GUIDERIUS.
I have spoke it, and I did it.

CYMBELINE.
He was a prince.

GUIDERIUS.
A most incivil one. The wrongs he did me
Were nothing prince-like; for he did provoke me
With language that would make me spurn the sea,
If it could so roar to me. I cut off_s head,
And am right glad he is not standing here
To tell this tale of mine.

CYMBELINE.
I am sorry for thee.
By thine own tongue thou art condemn_d, and must
Endure our law. Thou_rt dead.

IMOGEN.
That headless man
I thought had been my lord.

CYMBELINE.
Bind the offender,
And take him from our presence.

BELARIUS.
Stay, sir King.
This man is better than the man he slew,
As well descended as thyself, and hath
More of thee merited than a band of Clotens
Had ever scar for. [_To the guard._] Let his arms alone;
They were not born for bondage.

CYMBELINE.
Why, old soldier,
Wilt thou undo the worth thou art unpaid for
By tasting of our wrath? How of descent
As good as we?

ARVIRAGUS.
In that he spake too far.

CYMBELINE.
And thou shalt die for_t.

BELARIUS.
We will die all three;
But I will prove that two on_s are as good
As I have given out him. My sons, I must
For mine own part unfold a dangerous speech,
Though haply well for you.

ARVIRAGUS.
Your danger_s ours.

GUIDERIUS.
And our good his.

BELARIUS.
Have at it then by leave!
Thou hadst, great King, a subject who
Was call_d Belarius.

CYMBELINE.
What of him? He is
A banish_d traitor.

BELARIUS.
He it is that hath
Assum_d this age; indeed a banish’d man;
I know not how a traitor.

CYMBELINE.
Take him hence,
The whole world shall not save him.

BELARIUS.
Not too hot.
First pay me for the nursing of thy sons,
And let it be confiscate all, so soon
As I have receiv_d it.

CYMBELINE.
Nursing of my sons?

BELARIUS.
I am too blunt and saucy: here_s my knee.
Ere I arise I will prefer my sons;
Then spare not the old father. Mighty sir,
These two young gentlemen that call me father,
And think they are my sons, are none of mine;
They are the issue of your loins, my liege,
And blood of your begetting.

CYMBELINE.
How? my issue?

BELARIUS.
So sure as you your father_s. I, old Morgan,
Am that Belarius whom you sometime banish_d.
Your pleasure was my mere offence, my punishment
Itself, and all my treason; that I suffer_d
Was all the harm I did. These gentle princes
(For such and so they are) these twenty years
Have I train_d up; those arts they have as I
Could put into them. My breeding was, sir, as
Your Highness knows. Their nurse, Euriphile,
Whom for the theft I wedded, stole these children
Upon my banishment; I mov_d her to’t,
Having receiv_d the punishment before
For that which I did then. Beaten for loyalty
Excited me to treason. Their dear loss,
The more of you _twas felt, the more it shap’d
Unto my end of stealing them. But, gracious sir,
Here are your sons again, and I must lose
Two of the sweet_st companions in the world.
The benediction of these covering heavens
Fall on their heads like dew! for they are worthy
To inlay heaven with stars.

CYMBELINE.
Thou weep_st and speak’st.
The service that you three have done is more
Unlike than this thou tell_st. I lost my children.
If these be they, I know not how to wish
A pair of worthier sons.

BELARIUS.
Be pleas_d awhile.
This gentleman, whom I call Polydore,
Most worthy prince, as yours, is true Guiderius;
This gentleman, my Cadwal, Arviragus,
Your younger princely son; he, sir, was lapp_d
In a most curious mantle, wrought by th_ hand
Of his queen mother, which for more probation
I can with ease produce.

CYMBELINE.
Guiderius had
Upon his neck a mole, a sanguine star;
It was a mark of wonder.

BELARIUS.
This is he,
Who hath upon him still that natural stamp.
It was wise nature_s end in the donation,
To be his evidence now.

CYMBELINE.
O, what am I?
A mother to the birth of three? Ne_er mother
Rejoic_d deliverance more. Blest pray you be,
That, after this strange starting from your orbs,
You may reign in them now! O Imogen,
Thou hast lost by this a kingdom.

IMOGEN.
No, my lord;
I have got two worlds by_t. O my gentle brothers,
Have we thus met? O, never say hereafter
But I am truest speaker! You call_d me brother,
When I was but your sister: I you brothers,
When we were so indeed.

CYMBELINE.
Did you e_er meet?

ARVIRAGUS.
Ay, my good lord.

GUIDERIUS.
And at first meeting lov_d,
Continu_d so until we thought he died.

CORNELIUS.
By the Queen_s dram she swallow’d.

CYMBELINE.
O rare instinct!
When shall I hear all through? This fierce abridgement
Hath to it circumstantial branches, which
Distinction should be rich in. Where? how liv_d you?
And when came you to serve our Roman captive?
How parted with your brothers? how first met them?
Why fled you from the court? and whither? These,
And your three motives to the battle, with
I know not how much more, should be demanded,
And all the other by-dependances,
From chance to chance; but nor the time nor place
Will serve our long interrogatories. See,
Posthumus anchors upon Imogen;
