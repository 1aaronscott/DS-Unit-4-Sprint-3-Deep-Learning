Dies not alone; but like a gulf doth draw
What_s near it with it. It is a massy wheel
Fix_d on the summit of the highest mount,
To whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things
Are mortis_d and adjoin’d; which when it falls,
Each small annexment, petty consequence,
Attends the boist_rous ruin. Never alone
Did the King sigh, but with a general groan.

KING.
Arm you, I pray you, to this speedy voyage;
For we will fetters put upon this fear,
Which now goes too free-footed.

ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN.
We will haste us.

 [_Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern._]

 Enter Polonius.

POLONIUS.
My lord, he_s going to his mother’s closet.
Behind the arras I_ll convey myself
To hear the process. I_ll warrant she’ll tax him home,
And as you said, and wisely was it said,
_Tis meet that some more audience than a mother,
Since nature makes them partial, should o_erhear
The speech of vantage. Fare you well, my liege,
I_ll call upon you ere you go to bed,
And tell you what I know.

KING.
Thanks, dear my lord.

 [_Exit Polonius._]

O, my offence is rank, it smells to heaven;
It hath the primal eldest curse upon_t,—
A brother_s murder! Pray can I not,
Though inclination be as sharp as will:
My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent,
And, like a man to double business bound,
I stand in pause where I shall first begin,
And both neglect. What if this cursed hand
Were thicker than itself with brother_s blood,
Is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens
To wash it white as snow? Whereto serves mercy
But to confront the visage of offence?
And what_s in prayer but this twofold force,
To be forestalled ere we come to fall,
Or pardon_d being down? Then I’ll look up.
My fault is past. But O, what form of prayer
Can serve my turn? Forgive me my foul murder!
That cannot be; since I am still possess_d
Of those effects for which I did the murder,—
My crown, mine own ambition, and my queen.
May one be pardon_d and retain th’offence?
In the corrupted currents of this world
Offence_s gilded hand may shove by justice,
And oft _tis seen the wicked prize itself
Buys out the law. But _tis not so above;
There is no shuffling, there the action lies
In his true nature, and we ourselves compell_d
Even to the teeth and forehead of our faults,
To give in evidence. What then? What rests?
Try what repentance can. What can it not?
Yet what can it, when one cannot repent?
O wretched state! O bosom black as death!
O limed soul, that struggling to be free,
Art more engag_d! Help, angels! Make assay:
Bow, stubborn knees; and heart with strings of steel,
Be soft as sinews of the new-born babe.
All may be well.

 [_Retires and kneels._]

 Enter Hamlet.

HAMLET.
Now might I do it pat, now he is praying.
And now I_ll do’t. And so he goes to heaven;
And so am I reveng_d. That would be scann’d:
A villain kills my father, and for that
I, his sole son, do this same villain send
To heaven. O, this is hire and salary, not revenge.
He took my father grossly, full of bread,
With all his crimes broad blown, as flush as May;
And how his audit stands, who knows save heaven?
But in our circumstance and course of thought,
_Tis heavy with him. And am I then reveng’d,
To take him in the purging of his soul,
When he is fit and season_d for his passage? No.
Up, sword, and know thou a more horrid hent:
When he is drunk asleep; or in his rage,
Or in th_incestuous pleasure of his bed,
At gaming, swearing; or about some act
That has no relish of salvation in_t,
Then trip him, that his heels may kick at heaven,
And that his soul may be as damn_d and black
As hell, whereto it goes. My mother stays.
This physic but prolongs thy sickly days.

 [_Exit._]

 The King rises and advances.

KING.
My words fly up, my thoughts remain below.
Words without thoughts never to heaven go.

 [_Exit._]

SCENE IV. Another room in the Castle.

 Enter Queen and Polonius.

POLONIUS.
He will come straight. Look you lay home to him,
Tell him his pranks have been too broad to bear with,
And that your Grace hath screen_d and stood between
Much heat and him. I_ll silence me e’en here.
Pray you be round with him.

HAMLET.
[_Within._] Mother, mother, mother.

QUEEN.
I_ll warrant you, Fear me not.
Withdraw, I hear him coming.

 [_Polonius goes behind the arras._]

 Enter Hamlet.

HAMLET.
Now, mother, what_s the matter?

QUEEN.
Hamlet, thou hast thy father much offended.

HAMLET.
Mother, you have my father much offended.

QUEEN.
Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue.

HAMLET.
Go, go, you question with a wicked tongue.

QUEEN.
Why, how now, Hamlet?

HAMLET.
What_s the matter now?

QUEEN.
Have you forgot me?

HAMLET.
No, by the rood, not so.
You are the Queen, your husband_s brother’s wife,
And, would it were not so. You are my mother.

QUEEN.
Nay, then I_ll set those to you that can speak.

HAMLET.
Come, come, and sit you down, you shall not budge.
You go not till I set you up a glass
Where you may see the inmost part of you.

QUEEN.
What wilt thou do? Thou wilt not murder me?
Help, help, ho!

POLONIUS.
[_Behind._] What, ho! help, help, help!

HAMLET.
How now? A rat? [_Draws._]
Dead for a ducat, dead!

 [_Makes a pass through the arras._]

POLONIUS.
[_Behind._] O, I am slain!

 [_Falls and dies._]

QUEEN.
O me, what hast thou done?

HAMLET.
Nay, I know not. is it the King?

 [_Draws forth Polonius._]

QUEEN.
O what a rash and bloody deed is this!

HAMLET.
A bloody deed. Almost as bad, good mother,
As kill a king and marry with his brother.

QUEEN.
As kill a king?

HAMLET.
Ay, lady, _twas my word.—
[_To Polonius._] Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell!
I took thee for thy better. Take thy fortune,
Thou find_st to be too busy is some danger.—
Leave wringing of your hands. Peace, sit you down,
And let me wring your heart, for so I shall,
If it be made of penetrable stuff;
If damned custom have not braz_d it so,
That it is proof and bulwark against sense.

QUEEN.
What have I done, that thou dar_st wag thy tongue
In noise so rude against me?

HAMLET.
Such an act
That blurs the grace and blush of modesty,
Calls virtue hypocrite, takes off the rose
From the fair forehead of an innocent love,
And sets a blister there. Makes marriage vows
As false as dicers_ oaths. O such a deed
As from the body of contraction plucks
The very soul, and sweet religion makes
A rhapsody of words. Heaven_s face doth glow,
Yea this solidity and compound mass,
With tristful visage, as against the doom,
Is thought-sick at the act.

QUEEN.
Ay me, what act,
That roars so loud, and thunders in the index?

HAMLET.
Look here upon this picture, and on this,
The counterfeit presentment of two brothers.
See what a grace was seated on this brow,
Hyperion_s curls, the front of Jove himself,
An eye like Mars, to threaten and command,
A station like the herald Mercury
New lighted on a heaven-kissing hill:
A combination and a form indeed,
Where every god did seem to set his seal,
To give the world assurance of a man.
This was your husband. Look you now what follows.
Here is your husband, like a mildew_d ear
Blasting his wholesome brother. Have you eyes?
Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed,
And batten on this moor? Ha! have you eyes?
You cannot call it love; for at your age
The hey-day in the blood is tame, it_s humble,
And waits upon the judgment: and what judgment
Would step from this to this? Sense sure you have,
Else could you not have motion; but sure that sense
Is apoplex_d, for madness would not err
Nor sense to ecstacy was ne_er so thrall’d
But it reserv_d some quantity of choice
To serve in such a difference. What devil was_t
That thus hath cozen_d you at hoodman-blind?
Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight,
Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,
Or but a sickly part of one true sense
Could not so mope. O shame! where is thy blush?
Rebellious hell,
If thou canst mutine in a matron_s bones,
To flaming youth let virtue be as wax,
And melt in her own fire. Proclaim no shame
When the compulsive ardour gives the charge,
Since frost itself as actively doth burn,
And reason panders will.

QUEEN.
O Hamlet, speak no more.
Thou turn_st mine eyes into my very soul,
And there I see such black and grained spots
As will not leave their tinct.

HAMLET.
Nay, but to live
In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed,
Stew_d in corruption, honeying and making love
Over the nasty sty.

QUEEN.
O speak to me no more;
These words like daggers enter in mine ears;
No more, sweet Hamlet.

HAMLET.
A murderer and a villain;
A slave that is not twentieth part the tithe
Of your precedent lord. A vice of kings,
