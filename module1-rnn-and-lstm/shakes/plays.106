Over whose acres walk_d those blessed feet
Which fourteen hundred years ago were nail_d
For our advantage on the bitter cross.
But this our purpose now is twelvemonth old,
And bootless _tis to tell you we will go:
Therefore we meet not now.—Then let me hear
Of you, my gentle cousin Westmoreland,
What yesternight our Council did decree
In forwarding this dear expedience.

WESTMORELAND.
My liege, this haste was hot in question,
And many limits of the charge set down
But yesternight; when, all athwart, there came
A post from Wales loaden with heavy news;
Whose worst was, that the noble Mortimer,
Leading the men of Herefordshire to fight
Against th_ irregular and wild Glendower,
Was by the rude hands of that Welshman taken;
A thousand of his people butchered,
Upon whose dead corpse_ there was such misuse,
Such beastly, shameless transformation,
By those Welshwomen done, as may not be
Without much shame re-told or spoken of.

KING.
It seems, then, that the tidings of this broil
Brake off our business for the Holy Land.

WESTMORELAND.
This, match_d with other, did, my gracious lord;
For more uneven and unwelcome news
Came from the North, and thus it did import:
On Holy-rood day the gallant Hotspur there,
Young Harry Percy, and brave Archibald,
That ever-valiant and approved Scot,
At Holmedon met;
Where they did spend a sad and bloody hour,
As by discharge of their artillery,
And shape of likelihood, the news was told;
For he that brought them, in the very heat
And pride of their contention did take horse,
Uncertain of the issue any way.

KING.
Here is a dear and true-industrious friend,
Sir Walter Blunt, new lighted from his horse,
Stain_d with the variation of each soil
Betwixt that Holmedon and this seat of ours;
And he hath brought us smooth and welcome news.
The Earl of Douglas is discomfited:
Ten thousand bold Scots, two-and-twenty knights,
Balk_d in their own blood, did Sir Walter see
On Holmedon_s plains:  of prisoners, Hotspur took
Mordake the Earl of Fife and eldest son
To beaten Douglas; and the Earls of Athol,
Of Murray, Angus, and Menteith.
And is not this an honourable spoil,
A gallant prize? ha, cousin, is it not?

WESTMORELAND.
Faith, _tis a conquest for a prince to boast of.

KING.
Yea, there thou makest me sad, and makest me sin
In envy that my Lord Northumberland
Should be the father to so blest a son,—
A son who is the theme of honour_s tongue;
Amongst a grove, the very straightest plant;
Who is sweet Fortune_s minion and her pride:
Whilst I, by looking on the praise of him,
See riot and dishonour stain the brow
Of my young Harry. O, that it could be proved
That some night-tripping fairy had exchanged
In cradle-clothes our children where they lay,
And call_d mine Percy, his Plantagenet!
Then would I have his Harry, and he mine:
But let him from my thoughts. What think you, coz,
Of this young Percy_s pride? the prisoners,
Which he in this adventure hath surprised,
To his own use he keeps; and sends me word,
I shall have none but Mordake Earl of Fife.

WESTMORELAND.
This is his uncle_s teaching, this is Worcester,
Malevolent to you in all aspects;
Which makes him prune himself, and bristle up
The crest of youth against your dignity.

KING.
But I have sent for him to answer this;
And for this cause awhile we must neglect
Our holy purpose to Jerusalem.
Cousin, on Wednesday next our Council we
Will hold at Windsor; so inform the lords:
But come yourself with speed to us again;
For more is to be said and to be done
Than out of anger can be uttered.

WESTMORELAND.
I will, my liege.

[Exeunt.]

SCENE II. The same. An Apartment of Prince Henry_s.

[Enter Prince Henry and Falstaff.]

FALSTAFF.
Now, Hal, what time of day is it, lad?

PRINCE.
Thou art so fat-witted, with drinking of old sack, and unbuttoning thee
after supper, and sleeping upon benches after noon, that thou hast
forgotten to demand that truly which thou wouldst truly know. What a
devil hast thou to do with the time of the day? unless hours were cups
of sack, and minutes capons, and the blessed Sun himself a fair hot
wench in flame-coloured taffeta, I see no reason why thou shouldst be
so superfluous to demand the time of the day.

FALSTAFF.
Indeed, you come near me now, Hal; for we that take purses go by the
Moon and the seven stars, and not by Phoebus,—he, that wandering knight
so fair. And I pr_ythee, sweet wag, when thou art king,—as, God save
thy Grace—Majesty I should say, for grace thou wilt have none,—

PRINCE.
What, none?

FALSTAFF.
No, by my troth; not so much as will serve to be prologue to an egg and
butter.

PRINCE.
Well, how then? come, roundly, roundly.

FALSTAFF.
Marry, then, sweet wag, when thou art king, let not us that are squires
of the night_s body be called thieves of the day’s beauty:  let us be
Diana_s foresters, gentlemen of the shade, minions of the Moon; and let
men say we be men of good government, being governed, as the sea is, by
our noble and chaste mistress the Moon, under whose countenance we
steal.

PRINCE.
Thou say_st well, and it holds well too; for the fortune of us that are
the Moon_s men doth ebb and flow like the sea, being governed, as the
sea is, by the Moon. As, for proof, now: A purse of gold most
resolutely snatch_d on Monday night, and most dissolutely spent on
Tuesday morning; got with swearing Lay by, and spent with crying Bring
in; now ill as low an ebb as the foot of the ladder, and by-and-by in
as high a flow as the ridge of the gallows.

FALSTAFF.
By the Lord, thou say_st true, lad.  And is not my hostess of the
tavern a most sweet wench?

PRINCE.
As the honey of Hybla, my old lad of the castle.  And is not a buff
jerkin a most sweet robe of durance?

FALSTAFF.
How now, how now, mad wag! what, in thy quips and thy quiddities? what
a plague have I to do with a buff jerkin?

PRINCE.
Why, what a pox have I to do with my hostess of the tavern?

FALSTAFF.
Well, thou hast call_d her to a reckoning many a time and oft.

PRINCE.
Did I ever call for thee to pay thy part?

FALSTAFF.
No; I_ll give thee thy due, thou hast paid all there.

PRINCE.
Yea, and elsewhere, so far as my coin would stretch; and where it would
not, I have used my credit.

FALSTAFF.
Yea, and so used it, that, were it not here apparent that thou art
heir-apparent—But I pr_ythee, sweet wag, shall there be gallows
standing in England when thou art king? and resolution thus fobb_d as
it is with the rusty curb of old father antic the law? Do not thou,
when thou art king, hang a thief.

PRINCE.
No; thou shalt.

FALSTAFF.
Shall I? O rare! By the Lord, I_ll be a brave judge.

PRINCE.
Thou judgest false already:  I mean, thou shalt have the hanging of the
thieves, and so become a rare hangman.

FALSTAFF.
Well, Hal, well; and in some sort it jumps with my humour; as well as
waiting in the Court, I can tell you.

PRINCE.
For obtaining of suits?

FALSTAFF.
Yea, for obtaining of suits, whereof the hangman hath no lean wardrobe.
_Sblood, I am as melancholy as a gib-cat or a lugg’d bear.

PRINCE.
Or an old lion, or a lover_s lute.

FALSTAFF.
Yea, or the drone of a Lincolnshire bagpipe.

PRINCE.
What say_st thou to a hare, or the melancholy of Moor-ditch?

FALSTAFF.
Thou hast the most unsavoury similes, and art, indeed, the most
comparative, rascalliest, sweet young prince,—But, Hal, I pr_ythee
trouble me no more with vanity. I would to God thou and I knew where a
commodity of good names were to be bought. An old lord of the Council
rated me the other day in the street about you, sir,—but I mark_d him
not; and yet he talk_d very wisely,—but I regarded him not; and yet he
talk_d wisely, and in the street too.

PRINCE.
Thou didst well; for wisdom cries out in the streets, and no man
regards it.

FALSTAFF.
O, thou hast damnable iteration, and art, indeed, able to corrupt a
saint. Thou hast done much harm upon me, Hal; God forgive thee for it!
Before I knew thee, Hal, I knew nothing; and now am I, if a man should
speak truly, little better than one of the wicked. I must give over
this life, and I will give it over; by the Lord, an I do not, I am a
villain:  I_ll be damn’d for never a king’s son in Christendom.

PRINCE.
Where shall we take a purse to-morrow, Jack?

FALSTAFF.
Zounds, where thou wilt, lad; I_ll make one:  an I do not, call me
villain, and baffle me.

PRINCE.
I see a good amendment of life in thee,—from praying to purse-taking.

FALSTAFF.
Why, Hal, _tis my vocation, Hal; ’tis no sin for a man to labour in his
vocation.

[Enter Poins.]

POINS.
Now shall we know if Gadshill have set a match. O, if men were to be
saved by merit, what hole in Hell were hot enough for him? This is the
most omnipotent villain that ever cried Stand! to a true man.

PRINCE.
Good morrow, Ned.

POINS.
Good morrow, sweet Hal.—What says Monsieur Remorse? what says Sir John
Sack-and-sugar? Jack, how agrees the Devil and thee about thy soul,
that thou soldest him on Good-Friday last for a cup of Madeira and a
cold capon_s leg?

PRINCE.
Sir John stands to his word,—the Devil shall have his bargain;
for he was never yet a breaker of proverbs,—he will give the
Devil his due.

POINS.
Then art thou damn_d for keeping thy word with the Devil.

PRINCE.
Else he had been damn_d for cozening the Devil.

POINS.
But, my lads, my lads, to-morrow morning, by four o_clock, early at
Gads-hill! there are pilgrims gong to Canterbury with rich offerings,
and traders riding to London with fat purses: I have visards for you
all; you have horses for yourselves:  Gadshill lies to-night in
Rochester:  I have bespoke supper to-morrow night in Eastcheap:  we may
do it as secure as sleep. If you will go, I will stuff your purses full
of crowns; if you will not, tarry at home and be hang_d.

FALSTAFF.
Hear ye, Yedward; if I tarry at home and go not, I_ll hang you for
going.

POINS.
You will, chops?

FALSTAFF.
Hal, wilt thou make one?

PRINCE.
