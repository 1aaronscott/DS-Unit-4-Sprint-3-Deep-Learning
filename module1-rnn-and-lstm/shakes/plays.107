Who, I rob? I a thief? not I, by my faith.

FALSTAFF.
There_s neither honesty, manhood, nor good fellowship in thee, nor thou
camest not of the blood royal, if thou darest not stand for ten
shillings.

PRINCE.
Well, then, once in my days I_ll be a madcap.

FALSTAFF.
Why, that_s well said.

PRINCE.
Well, come what will, I_ll tarry at home.

FALSTAFF.
By the Lord, I_ll be a traitor, then, when thou art king.

PRINCE.
I care not.

POINS.
Sir John, I pr_ythee, leave the Prince and me alone: I will lay him
down such reasons for this adventure, that he shall go.

FALSTAFF.
Well, God give thee the spirit of persuasion, and him the ears of
profiting, that what thou speakest may move, and what he hears may be
believed, that the true Prince may, for recreation- sake, prove a false
thief; for the poor abuses of the time want countenance. Farewell; you
shall find me in Eastcheap.

PRINCE.
Farewell, thou latter Spring! farewell, All-hallown Summer!

[Exit Falstaff.]

POINS.
Now, my good sweet honey-lord, ride with us to-morrow:  I have a jest
to execute that I cannot manage alone. Falstaff, Bardolph, Peto, and
Gadshill, shall rob those men that we have already waylaid:  yourself
and I will not be there; and when they have the booty, if you and I do
not rob them, cut this head off from my shoulders.

PRINCE.
But how shall we part with them in setting forth?

POINS.
Why, we will set forth before or after them, and appoint them a place
of meeting, wherein it is at our pleasure to fail; and then will they
adventure upon the exploit themselves; which they shall have no sooner
achieved but we_ll set upon them.

PRINCE.
Ay, but _tis like that they will know us by our horses, by our habits,
and by every other appointment, to be ourselves.

POINS.
Tut! our horses they shall not see,—I_ll tie them in the wood; our
visards we will change, after we leave them; and, sirrah, I have cases
of buckram for the nonce, to immask our noted outward garments.

PRINCE.
But I doubt they will be too hard for us.

POINS.
Well, for two of them, I know them to be as true-bred cowards as ever
turn_d back; and for the third, if he fight longer than he sees reason,
I_ll forswear arms. The virtue of this jest will be, the
incomprehensible lies that this same fat rogue will tell us when we
meet at supper: how thirty, at least, he fought with; what wards, what
blows, what extremities he endured; and in the reproof of this lies the
jest.

PRINCE.
Well, I_ll go with thee:  provide us all things necessary and meet me
to-night in Eastcheap; there I_ll sup. Farewell.

POINS.
Farewell, my lord.

[Exit.]

PRINCE.
I know you all, and will awhile uphold
The unyok_d humour of your idleness:
Yet herein will I imitate the Sun,
Who doth permit the base contagious clouds
To smother-up his beauty from the world,
That, when he please again to be himself,
Being wanted, he may be more wonder_d at,
By breaking through the foul and ugly mists
Of vapours that did seem to strangle him.
If all the year were playing holidays,
To sport would be as tedious as to work;
But, when they seldom come, they wish_d-for come,
And nothing pleaseth but rare accidents.
So, when this loose behaviour I throw off,
And pay the debt I never promised,
By how much better than my word I am,
By so much shall I falsify men_s hopes;
And, like bright metal on a sullen ground,
My reformation, glittering o_er my fault,
Shall show more goodly and attract more eyes
Than that which hath no foil to set it off.
I_ll so offend, to make offence a skill;
Redeeming time, when men think least I will.

[Exit.]

SCENE III. The Same. A Room in the Palace.

[Enter King Henry, Northumberland, Worcester, Hotspur, Sir Walter
Blunt, and others.]

KING.
My blood hath been too cold and temperate,
Unapt to stir at these indignities,
And you have found me; for, accordingly,
You tread upon my patience:  but be sure
I will from henceforth rather be myself,
Mighty and to be fear_d, than my condition,
Which hath been smooth as oil, soft as young down,
And therefore lost that title of respect
Which the proud soul ne_er pays but to the proud.

WORCESTER.
Our House, my sovereign liege, little deserves
The scourge of greatness to be used on it;
And that same greatness too which our own hands
Have holp to make so portly.

NORTHUMBERLAND.
My good lord,—

KING.
Worcester, get thee gone; for I do see
Danger and disobedience in thine eye:
O, sir, your presence is too bold and peremptory,
And majesty might never yet endure
The moody frontier of a servant brow.
You have good leave to leave us:  when we need
Your use and counsel, we shall send for you.

[Exit Worcester.]

[To Northumberland.]

You were about to speak.

NORTHUMBERLAND.
Yea, my good lord.
Those prisoners in your Highness_ name demanded,
Which Harry Percy here at Holmedon took,
Were, as he says, not with such strength denied
As is deliver_d to your Majesty:
Either envy, therefore, or misprision
Is guilty of this fault, and not my son.

HOTSPUR.
My liege, I did deny no prisoners.
But, I remember, when the fight was done,
When I was dry with rage and extreme toil,
Breathless and faint, leaning upon my sword,
Came there a certain lord, neat, trimly dress_d,
Fresh as a bridegroom; and his chin new reap_d
Show_d like a stubble-land at harvest-home:
He was perfumed like a milliner;
And _twixt his finger and his thumb he held
A pouncet-box, which ever and anon
He gave his nose, and took_t away again;
Who therewith angry, when it next came there,
Took it in snuff:  and still he smiled and talk_d;
And, as the soldiers bore dead bodies by,
He call_d them untaught knaves, unmannerly,
To bring a slovenly unhandsome corse
Betwixt the wind and his nobility.
With many holiday and lady terms
He question_d me; amongst the rest, demanded
My prisoners in your Majesty_s behalf.
I then, all smarting with my wounds being cold,
Out of my grief and my impatience
To be so pester_d with a popinjay,
Answer_d neglectingly, I know not what,—
He should, or he should not; for_t made me mad
To see him shine so brisk, and smell so sweet,
And talk so like a waiting-gentlewoman
Of guns and drums and wounds,—God save the mark!—
And telling me the sovereign_st thing on Earth
Was parmaceti for an inward bruise;
And that it was great pity, so it was,
This villainous salt-petre should be digg_d
Out of the bowels of the harmless earth,
Which many a good tall fellow had destroy_d
So cowardly; and, but for these vile guns,
He would himself have been a soldier.
This bald unjointed chat of his, my lord,
I answered indirectly, as I said;
And I beseech you, let not his report
Come current for an accusation
Betwixt my love and your high Majesty.

BLUNT.
The circumstance consider_d, good my lord,
Whatever Harry Percy then had said
To such a person, and in such a place,
At such a time, with all the rest re-told,
May reasonably die, and never rise
To do him wrong, or any way impeach
What then he said, so he unsay it now.

KING.
Why, yet he doth deny his prisoners,
But with proviso and exception,
That we at our own charge shall ransom straight
His brother-in-law, the foolish Mortimer;
Who, on my soul, hath wilfully betray_d
The lives of those that he did lead to fight
Against that great magician, damn_d Glendower,
Whose daughter, as we hear, the Earl of March
Hath lately married. Shall our coffers, then,
Be emptied to redeem a traitor home?
Shall we buy treason? and indent with fears
When they have lost and forfeited themselves?
No, on the barren mountains let him starve;
For I shall never hold that man my friend
Whose tongue shall ask me for one penny cost
To ransom home revolted Mortimer.

HOTSPUR.
Revolted Mortimer!
He never did fall off, my sovereign liege,
But by the chance of war:  to prove that true
Needs no more but one tongue for all those wounds,
Those mouthed wounds, which valiantly he took,
When on the gentle Severn_s sedgy bank,
In single opposition, hand to hand,
He did confound the best part of an hour
In changing hardiment with great Glendower.
Three times they breathed, and three times did they drink,
Upon agreement, of swift Severn_s flood;
Who then, affrighted with their bloody looks,
Ran fearfully among the trembling reeds,
And hid his crisp head in the hollow bank
Blood-stained with these valiant combatants.
Never did base and rotten policy
Colour her working with such deadly wounds;
Nor never could the noble Mortimer
Receive so many, and all willingly:
Then let not him be slander_d with revolt.

KING.
Thou dost belie him, Percy, thou dost belie him;
He never did encounter with Glendower:
I tell thee,
He durst as well have met the Devil alone
As Owen Glendower for an enemy.
Art not ashamed? But, sirrah, henceforth
Let me not hear you speak of Mortimer:
Send me your prisoners with the speediest means,
Or you shall hear in such a kind from me
As will displease you.—My Lord Northumberland,
We license your departure with your son.—
Send us your prisoners, or you_ll hear of it.

[Exeunt King Henry, Blunt, and train.]

HOTSPUR.
An if the Devil come and roar for them,
I will not send them:  I will after straight,
And tell him so; for I will else my heart,
Although it be with hazard of my head.

NORTHUMBERLAND.
What, drunk with choler? stay, and pause awhile:
Here comes your uncle.

[Re-enter Worcester.]

HOTSPUR.
Speak of Mortimer!
Zounds, I will speak of him; and let my soul
Want mercy, if I do not join with him:
Yea, on his part I_ll empty all these veins,
And shed my dear blood drop by drop i_ the dust,
But I will lift the down-trod Mortimer
As high i_ the air as this unthankful King,
As this ingrate and canker_d Bolingbroke.

NORTH.
[To Worcester.]
Brother, the King hath made your nephew mad.

WORCESTER.
Who struck this heat up after I was gone?

HOTSPUR.
He will, forsooth, have all my prisoners;
And when I urged the ransom once again
