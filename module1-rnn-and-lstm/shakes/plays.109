Good morrow, carriers. What_s o’clock?

FIRST CARRIER.
I think it be two o_clock.

GADSHILL.
I pr_ythee, lend me thy lantern, to see my gelding in the stable.

FIRST CARRIER.
Nay, soft, I pray ye; I know a trick worth two of that, i_faith.

GADSHILL.
I pr_ythee, lend me thine.

SECOND CARRIER.
Ay, when? canst tell? Lend me thy lantern, quoth a? marry, I_ll see
thee hang_d first.

GADSHILL.
Sirrah carrier, what time do you mean to come to London?

SECOND CARRIER.
Time enough to go to bed with a candle, I warrant thee.—
Come, neighbour Muggs, we_ll call up the gentlemen:  they will
along with company, for they have great charge.

[Exeunt Carriers.]

GADSHILL.
What, ho! chamberlain!

CHAMBERLAIN.
[Within.] At hand, quoth pick-purse.

GADSHILL.
That_s even as fair as—at hand, quoth the chamberlain; for thou variest
no more from picking of purses than giving direction doth from
labouring; thou lay_st the plot how.

[Enter Chamberlain.]

CHAMBERLAIN.
Good morrow, Master Gadshill. It holds current that I told you
yesternight:  there_s a franklin in the wild of Kent hath brought three
hundred marks with him in gold:  I heard him tell it to one of his
company last night at supper; a kind of auditor; one that hath
abundance of charge too, God knows what. They are up already, and call
for eggs and butter; they will away presently.

GADSHILL.
Sirrah, if they meet not with Saint Nicholas_ clerks, I’ll give thee
this neck.

CHAMBERLAIN.
No, I_ll none of it: I pr’ythee, keep that for the hangman; for
I know thou worshippest Saint Nicholas as truly as a man of
falsehood may.

GADSHILL.
What talkest thou to me of the hangman? if I hang, I_ll make a fat pair
of gallows; for, if I hang, old Sir John hangs with me, and thou
know_st he is no starveling. Tut! there are other Trojans that thou
dreamest not of, the which, for sport-sake, are content to do the
profession some grace; that would, if matters should be look_d into,
for their own credit-sake, make all whole. I am joined with no foot
land-rakers, no long-staff sixpenny strikers, none of these mad
mustachio purple-hued malt-worms; but with nobility and tranquillity,
burgomasters and great oneyers; such as can hold in, such as will
strike sooner than speak, and speak sooner than drink, and drink sooner
than pray:  and yet, zwounds, I lie; for they pray continually to their
saint, the Commonwealth; or, rather, not pray to her, but prey on her,
for they ride up and down on her, and make her their boots.

CHAMBERLAIN.
What, the Commonwealth their boots? will she hold out water in foul
way?

GADSHILL.
She will, she will; justice hath liquor_d her. We steal as in a castle,
cock-sure; we have the receipt of fernseed,—we walk invisible.

CHAMBERLAIN.
Nay, by my faith, I think you are more beholding to the night than to
fern-seed for your walking invisible.

GADSHILL.
Give me thy hand:  thou shalt have a share in our purchase, as
I am a true man.

CHAMBERLAIN.
Nay, rather let me have it, as you are a false thief.

GADSHILL.
Go to; homo is a common name to all men. Bid the ostler bring my
gelding out of the stable. Farewell, you muddy knave.

[Exeunt.]

SCENE II. The Road by Gads-hill.

[Enter Prince Henry and Poins; Bardolph and Peto at some distance.]

POINS.
Come, shelter, shelter:  I have remov_d Falstaff’s horse, and he frets
like a gumm_d velvet.

PRINCE.
Stand close.

[They retire.]

[Enter Falstaff.]

FALSTAFF.
Poins! Poins, and be hang_d! Poins!

PRINCE.
[Coming forward.]
Peace, ye fat-kidney_d rascal! what a brawling dost thou keep!

FALSTAFF.
Where_s Poins, Hal?

PRINCE.
He is walk_d up to the top of the hill: I’ll go seek him.

[Retires.]

FALSTAFF.
I am accursed to rob in that thief_s company:  the rascal hath removed
my horse, and tied him I know not where. If I travel but four foot by
the squire further a-foot, I shall break my wind. Well, I doubt not but
to die a fair death for all this, if I _scape hanging for killing that
rogue. I have forsworn his company hourly any time this two-and-twenty
year, and yet I am bewitch_d with the rogue’s company. If the rascal
have not given me medicines to make me love him, I_ll be hang’d; it
could not be else:  I have drunk medicines.— Poins!—Hal!—a plague upon
you both!—Bardolph!—Peto!—I_ll starve, ere I’ll rob a foot further. An
_twere not as good a deed as drink, to turn true man, and to leave
these rogues, I am the veriest varlet that ever chewed with a tooth.
Eight yards of uneven ground is threescore and ten miles a-foot with
me; and the stony-hearted villains know it well enough:  a plague
upon_t, when thieves cannot be true one to another! [They whistle.]
Whew!—A plague upon you all! Give me my horse, you rogues; give me my
horse, and be hang_d!

PRINCE.
[Coming forward.] Peace! lie down; lay thine ear close to the ground,
and list if thou canst hear the tread of travellers.

FALSTAFF.
Have you any levers to lift me up again, being down? _Sblood, I’ll not
bear mine own flesh so far a-foot again for all the coin in thy
father_s exchequer. What a plague mean ye to colt me thus?

PRINCE.
Thou liest; thou art not colted, thou art uncolted.

FALSTAFF.
I pr_ythee, good Prince Hal, help me to my horse, good king’s son.

PRINCE.
Out, ye rogue! shall I be your ostler?

FALSTAFF.
Go, hang thyself in thine own heir-apparent garters! If I be ta_en,
I_ll peach for this. An I have not ballads made on you all, and sung to
filthy tunes, let a cup of sack be my poison. When a jest is so
forward, and a-foot too, I hate it.

[Enter Gadshill.]

GADSHILL.
Stand!

FALSTAFF.
So I do, against my will.

POINS.
O, _tis our setter: I know his voice.

[Comes forward with Bardolph and Peto.]

BARDOLPH.
What news?

GADSHILL.
Case ye, case ye; on with your visards:  there_s money of the King’s
coming down the hill; _tis going to the King’s exchequer.

FALSTAFF.
You lie, ye rogue; _tis going to the King’s tavern.

GADSHILL.
There_s enough to make us all.

FALSTAFF.
To be hang_d.

PRINCE.
Sirs, you four shall front them in the narrow lane; Ned
Poins and I will walk lower; if they _scape from your
encounter, then they light on us.

PETO.
How many be there of them?

GADSHILL.
Some eight or ten.

FALSTAFF.
Zwounds, will they not rob us?

PRINCE.
What, a coward, Sir John Paunch?

FALSTAFF.
Indeed, I am not John of Gaunt, your grandfather; but yet no coward,
Hal.

PRINCE.
Well, we leave that to the proof.

POINS.
Sirrah Jack, thy horse stands behind the hedge:  when thou need_st him,
there thou shalt find him. Farewell, and stand fast.

FALSTAFF.
Now cannot I strike him, if I should be hang_d.

PRINCE.
[aside to POINTZ.] Ned, where are our disguises?

POINS.
[aside to PRINCE HENRY.] Here, hard by:  stand close.

[Exeunt Prince and Poins.]

FALSTAFF.
Now, my masters, happy man be his dole, say I:  every man to his
business.

[Enter Travellers.]

FIRST TRAVELLER.
Come, neighbour:
The boy shall lead our horses down the hill;
We_ll walk a-foot awhile and ease our legs.

FALSTAFF, GADSHILL., &C.
Stand!

SECOND TRAVELLER.
Jesu bless us!

FALSTAFF.
Strike; down with them; cut the villains_ throats. Ah, whoreson
caterpillars! bacon-fed knaves! they hate us youth: down with them;
fleece them.

FIRST TRAVELLER.
O, we_re undone, both we and ours for ever!

FALSTAFF.
Hang ye, gorbellied knaves, are ye undone? No, ye fat chuffs; I would
your store were here! On, bacons on! What, ye knaves! young men must
live. You are grand-jurors, are ye? we_ll jure ye, i’faith.

[Exeunt Fals., Gads., &c., driving the Travellers out.]

[Re-enter Prince Henry and Poins, in buckram suits.]

PRINCE.
The thieves have bound the true men. Now, could thou and I rob the
thieves, and go merrily to London, it would be argument for a week,
laughter for a month, and a good jest for ever.

POINS.
Stand close:  I hear them coming.

[They retire.]

[Re-enter Falstaff, Gadshill, Bardolph, and Peto.]

FALSTAFF.
Come, my masters, let us share, and then to horse before day.
An the Prince and Poins be not two arrant cowards, there_s no
equity stirring:  there_s no more valour in that Poins than in a

wild duck.

[As they are sharing, the Prince and Poins set upon them.]

PRINCE.
Your money!

POINS.
Villains!

[Falstaff, after a blow or two, and the others run away, leaving the
