booty behind them.]

PRINCE.
Got with much ease. Now merrily to horse:
The thieves are scatter_d, and possess’d with fear
So strongly that they dare not meet each other;
Each takes his fellow for an officer.
Away, good Ned. Fat Falstaff sweats to death,
And lards the lean earth as he walks along:
Were_t not for laughing, I should pity him.

POINS.
How the rogue roar_d!

SCENE III. Warkworth.  A Room in the Castle.

[Enter Hotspur, reading a letter.]

HOTSPUR.
—But, for mine own part, my lord, I could be well contented to be
there, in respect of the love I bear your House.—He could be contented;
why is he not, then? In respect of the love he bears our House!—he
shows in this, he loves his own barn better than he loves our house.
Let me see some more. The purpose you undertake is dangerous;—Why,
that_s certain:  ’tis dangerous to take a cold, to sleep, to drink; but
I tell you, my lord fool, out of this nettle, danger, we pluck this
flower, safety. The purpose you undertake is dangerous; the friends you
have named uncertain; the time itself unsorted; and your whole plot too
light for the counterpoise of so great an opposition.— Say you so, say
you so?  I say unto you again, you are a shallow, cowardly hind, and
you lie. What a lack-brain is this! By the Lord, our plot is a good
plot as ever was laid; our friends true and constant: a good plot, good
friends, and full of expectation; an excellent plot, very good friends.
What a frosty-spirited rogue is this! Why, my Lord of York commends the
plot and the general course of the action. Zwounds! an I were now by
this rascal, I could brain him with his lady_s fan. Is there not my
father, my uncle, and myself? Lord Edmund Mortimer, my Lord of York,
and Owen Glendower? is there not, besides, the Douglas? have I not all
their letters to meet me in arms by the ninth of the next month? and
are they not some of them set forward already? What a pagan rascal is
this! an infidel! Ha! you shall see now, in very sincerity of fear and
cold heart, will he to the King, and lay open all our proceedings. O, I
could divide myself, and go to buffets, for moving such a dish of
skimm_d milk with so honourable an action! Hang him! let him tell the
King:  we are prepared. I will set forward to-night.—

[Enter Lady Percy.]

How now, Kate! I must leave you within these two hours.

LADY PERCY.
O, my good lord, why are you thus alone?
For what offence have I this fortnight been
A banish_d woman from my Harry’s bed?
Tell me, sweet lord, what is_t that takes from thee
Thy stomach, pleasure, and thy golden sleep?
Why dost thou bend thine eyes upon the earth,
And start so often when thou sitt_st alone?
Why hast thou lost the fresh blood in thy cheeks;
And given my treasures and my rights of thee
To thick-eyed musing and curst melancholy?
In thy faint slumbers I by thee have watch_d,
And heard thee murmur tales of iron wars;
Speak terms of manage to thy bounding steed;
Cry Courage! to the field!  And thou hast talk_d
Of sallies and retires, of trenches, tents,
Of palisadoes, frontiers, parapets,
Of basilisks, of cannon, culverin,
Of prisoners ransomed, and of soldiers slain,
And all the currents of a heady fight.
Thy spirit within thee hath been so at war,
And thus hath so bestirr_d thee in thy sleep,
That beads of sweat have stood upon thy brow,
Like bubbles in a late-disturbed stream;
And in thy face strange motions have appear_d,
Such as we see when men restrain their breath
On some great sudden hest. O, what portents are these?
Some heavy business hath my lord in hand,
And I must know it, else he loves me not.

HOTSPUR.
What, ho!

[Enter a Servant.]

Is Gilliams with the packet gone?

SERVANT.
He is, my lord, an hour ago.

HOTSPUR.
Hath Butler brought those horses from the sheriff?

SERVANT.
One horse, my lord, he brought even now.

HOTSPUR.
What horse? a roan, a crop-ear, is it not?

SERVANT.
It is, my lord.

HOTSPUR.
That roan shall be my throne.
Well, I will back him straight:  O esperance!—
Bid Butler lead him forth into the park.

[Exit Servant.]

LADY PERCY.
But hear you, my lord.

HOTSPUR.
What say_st thou, my lady?

LADY PERCY.
What is it carries you away?

HOTSPUR.
Why, my horse, my love, my horse.

LADY PERCY.
Out, you mad-headed ape!
A weasel hath not such a deal of spleen
As you are toss_d with. In faith,
I_ll know your business, Harry, that I will.
I fear my brother Mortimer doth stir
About his title, and hath sent for you
To line his enterprise:  but if you go,—

HOTSPUR.
So far a-foot, I shall be weary, love.

LADY PERCY.
Come, come, you paraquito, answer me
Directly to this question that I ask:
In faith, I_ll break thy little finger, Harry,
An if thou wilt not tell me true.

HOTSPUR.
Away,
Away, you trifler! Love? I love thee not,
I care not for thee, Kate:  this is no world
To play with mammets and to tilt with lips:
We must have bloody noses and crack_d crowns,
And pass them current too.—Gods me, my horse!—
What say_st thou, Kate? what wouldst thou have with me?

LADY PERCY.
Do you not love me? do you not indeed?
Well, do not, then; for, since you love me not,
I will not love myself. Do you not love me?
Nay, tell me if you speak in jest or no.

HOTSPUR.
Come, wilt thou see me ride?
And when I am o_ horseback, I will swear
I love thee infinitely. But hark you, Kate;
I must not have you henceforth question me
Whither I go, nor reason whereabout:
Whither I must, I must; and, to conclude,
This evening must I leave you, gentle Kate.
I know you wise; but yet no further wise
Than Harry Percy_s wife; constant you are;
But yet a woman:  and, for secrecy,
No lady closer; for I well believe
Thou wilt not utter what thou dost not know;
And so far will I trust thee, gentle Kate.

LADY PERCY.
How! so far?

HOTSPUR.
Not an inch further. But hark you, Kate:
Whither I go, thither shall you go too;
To-day will I set forth, to-morrow you.
Will this content you, Kate?

LADY PERCY.
It must of force.

[Exeunt.]

SCENE IV. Eastcheap. A Room in the Boar_s-Head Tavern.

[Enter Prince Henry.]

PRINCE.
Ned, pr_ythee, come out of that fat room, and lend me thy hand to laugh
a little.

[Enter Poins.]

POINS.
Where hast been, Hal?

PRINCE.
With three or four loggerheads amongst three or fourscore hogsheads. I
have sounded the very base-string of humility. Sirrah, I am sworn
brother to a leash of drawers; and can call them all by their Christian
names, as, Tom, Dick, and Francis. They take it already upon their
salvation, that though I be but Prince of Wales, yet I am the king of
courtesy; and tell me flatly I am no proud Jack, like Falstaff, but a
corinthian, a lad of mettle, a good boy,—by the Lord, so they call
me;—and, when I am King of England, I shall command all the good lads
in Eastcheap. They call drinking deep, dying scarlet; and, when you
breathe in your watering, they cry hem! and bid you play it off. To
conclude, I am so good a proficient in one quarter of an hour, that I
can drink with any tinker in his own language during my life. I tell
thee, Ned, thou hast lost much honour, that thou wert not with me in
this action. But, sweet Ned,—to sweeten which name of Ned, I give thee
this pennyworth of sugar, clapp_d even now into my hand by an
under-skinker; one that never spake other English in his life than
Eight shillings and sixpence, and You are welcome; with this shrill
addition, Anon, anon, sir! Score a pint of bastard in the Half-moon,—or
so.  But, Ned, to drive away the time till Falstaff come, I pr_ythee,
do thou stand in some by-room, while I question my puny drawer to what
end he gave me the sugar; and do thou never leave calling Francis! that
his tale to me may be nothing but Anon.  Step aside, and I_ll show thee
a precedent.

[Exit Poins.]

POINS.
[Within.]  Francis!

PRINCE.

Thou art perfect.

POINS.
[Within.]  Francis!

[Enter Francis.]

FRANCIS.
Anon, anon, sir.—Look down into the Pomegranate, Ralph.

PRINCE.
Come hither, Francis.

FRANCIS.
My lord?

PRINCE.
How long hast thou to serve, Francis?

FRANCIS.
Forsooth, five years, and as much as to—

POINS.
[within.] Francis!

FRANCIS.
Anon, anon, sir.

PRINCE.
Five year! by_r Lady, a long lease for the clinking of pewter. But,
Francis, darest thou be so valiant as to play the coward with thy
indenture and show it a fair pair of heels and run from it?

FRANCIS.
O Lord, sir, I_ll be sworn upon all the books in England,
I could find in my heart—

POINS.
[within.] Francis!

FRANCIS.
Anon, anon, sir.

PRINCE.
How old art thou, Francis?

FRANCIS.
Let me see,—about Michaelmas next I shall be—

POINS.
[within.] Francis!

FRANCIS.
Anon, sir.—Pray you, stay a little, my lord.

PRINCE.
Nay, but hark you, Francis:  for the sugar thou gavest me, _twas a
pennyworth, was_t not?

FRANCIS.
O Lord, sir, I would it had been two!

PRINCE.
I will give thee for it a thousand pound:  ask me when thou wilt, and
thou shalt have it.

POINS.
[within.] Francis!

FRANCIS.
