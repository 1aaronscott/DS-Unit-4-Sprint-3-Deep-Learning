
SCENE II. London. A Room in the Palace.

[Enter King Henry, Prince Henry, and Lords.]

KING.
Lords, give us leave; the Prince of Wales and I
Must have some private conference: but be near at hand,
For we shall presently have need of you.

[Exeunt Lords.]

I know not whether God will have it so,
For some displeasing service I have done,
That, in His secret doom, out of my blood
He_ll breed revengement and a scourge for me;
But thou dost, in thy passages of life,
Make me believe that thou art only mark_d
For the hot vengeance and the rod of Heaven
To punish my mistreadings. Tell me else,
Could such inordinate and low desires,
Such poor, such base, such lewd, such mean attempts,
Such barren pleasures, rude society,
As thou art match_d withal and grafted to,
Accompany the greatness of thy blood,
And hold their level with thy princely heart?

PRINCE.
So please your Majesty, I would I could
Quit all offences with as clear excuse
As well as I am doubtless I can purge
Myself of many I am charged withal:
Yet such extenuation let me beg,
As, in reproof of many tales devised
By smiling pick-thanks and base news-mongers,—
Which oft the ear of greatness needs must hear,—
I may, for some things true, wherein my youth
Hath faulty wander_d and irregular,
Find pardon on my true submission.

KING.
God pardon thee! Yet let me wonder, Harry,
At thy affections, which do hold a wing
Quite from the flight of all thy ancestors.
Thy place in Council thou hast rudely lost,
Which by thy younger brother is supplied;
And art almost an alien to the hearts
Of all the Court and princes of my blood:
The hope and expectation of thy time
Is ruin_d; and the soul of every man
Prophetically does forethink thy fall.
Had I so lavish of my presence been,
So common-hackney_d in the eyes of men,
So stale and cheap to vulgar company,
Opinion, that did help me to the crown,
Had still kept loyal to possession,
And left me in reputeless banishment,

A fellow of no mark nor likelihood.
By being seldom seen, I could not stir
But, like a comet, I was wonder_d at;
That men would tell their children, This is he;
Others would say, Where, which is Bolingbroke?
And then I stole all courtesy from Heaven,
And dress_d myself in such humility,
That I did pluck allegiance from men_s hearts,
Loud shouts and salutations from their mouths,
Even in the presence of the crowned King.
Thus did I keep my person fresh and new;
My presence, like a robe pontifical,
Ne_er seen but wonder’d at:  and so my state,
Seldom but sumptuous, showed like a feast,
And won by rareness such solemnity.
The skipping King, he ambled up and down
With shallow jesters and rash bavin wits,
Soon kindled and soon burnt; carded his state,
Mingled his royalty, with capering fools;
Had his great name profaned with their scorns;
And gave his countenance, against his name,
To laugh at gibing boys, and stand the push
Of every beardless vain comparative;
Grew a companion to the common streets,
Enfeoff_d himself to popularity;
That, being dally swallow_d by men’s eyes,
They surfeited with honey, and began
To loathe the taste of sweetness, whereof a little
More than a little is by much too much.
So, when he had occasion to be seen,
He was but as the cuckoo is in June,
Heard, not regarded; seen, but with such eyes
As, sick and blunted with community,
Afford no extraordinary gaze,
Such as is bent on sun-like majesty
When it shines seldom in admiring eyes;
But rather drowsed, and hung their eyelids down,
Slept in his face, and render_d such aspect
As cloudy men use to their adversaries,
Being with his presence glutted, gorged, and full.
And in that very line, Harry, stand_st thou;
For thou hast lost thy princely privilege
With vile participation:  not an eye
But is a-weary of thy common sight,
Save mine, which hath desired to see thee more;
Which now doth that I would not have it do,
Make blind itself with foolish tenderness.

PRINCE.
I shall hereafter, my thrice-gracious lord,
Be more myself.

KING.
For all the world,
As thou art to this hour, was Richard then
When I from France set foot at Ravenspurg;
And even as I was then is Percy now.
Now, by my sceptre, and my soul to boot,
He hath more worthy interest to the state
Than thou, the shadow of succession;
For, of no right, nor colour like to right,
He doth fill fields with harness in the realm,
Turns head against the lion_s armed jaws;
And, being no more in debt to years than thou,
Leads ancient lords and reverend bishops on
To bloody battles and to bruising arms.
What never-dying honour hath he got
Against renowned Douglas! whose high deeds,
Whose hot incursions, and great name in arms,
Holds from all soldiers chief majority
And military title capital
Through all the kingdoms that acknowledge Christ:
Thrice hath this Hotspur, Mars in swathing-clothes,
This infant warrior, in his enterprises
Discomfited great Douglas; ta_en him once,
Enlarged him, and made a friend of him,
To fill the mouth of deep defiance up,
And shake the peace and safety of our throne.
And what say you to this? Percy, Northumberland,
Th_ Archbishop’s Grace of York, Douglas, and Mortimer
Capitulate against us, and are up.
But wherefore do I tell these news to thee?
Why, Harry, do I tell thee of my foes,
Which art my near_st and dearest enemy?
Thou that art like enough,—through vassal fear,
Base inclination, and the start of spleen,—
To fight against me under Percy_s pay,
To dog his heels, and curtsy at his frowns,
To show how much thou art degenerate.

PRINCE.
Do not think so; you shall not find it so:
And God forgive them that so much have sway_d
Your Majesty_s good thoughts away from me!
I will redeem all this on Percy_s head,
And, in the closing of some glorious day,
Be bold to tell you that I am your son;
When I will wear a garment all of blood,
And stain my favour in a bloody mask,
Which, wash_d away, shall scour my shame with it:
And that shall be the day, whene_er it lights,
That this same child of honour and renown,
This gallant Hotspur, this all-praised knight,
And your unthought-of Harry, chance to meet.
For every honour sitting on his helm,
Would they were multitudes, and on my head
My shames redoubled! for the time will come,
That I shall make this northern youth exchange
His glorious deeds for my indignities.
Percy is but my factor, good my lord,
T_ engross up glorious deeds on my behalf;
And I will call hall to so strict account,
That he shall render every glory up,
Yea, even the slightest worship of his time,
Or I will tear the reckoning from his heart.
This, in the name of God, I promise here:
The which if I perform, and do survive,
I do beseech your Majesty, may salve
The long-grown wounds of my intemperance:
If not, the end of life cancels all bands;
And I will die a hundred thousand deaths
Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.

KING.
A hundred thousand rebels die in this.
Thou shalt have charge and sovereign trust herein.—

[Enter Sir Walter Blunt.]

How now, good Blunt! thy looks are full of speed.

BLUNT.
So is the business that I come to speak of.
Lord Mortimer of Scotland hath sent word
That Douglas and the English rebels met
Th_ eleventh of this month at Shrewsbury:
A mighty and a fearful head they are,
If promises be kept on every hand,
As ever offer_d foul play in a State.

KING.
The Earl of Westmoreland set forth to-day;
With him my son, Lord John of Lancaster;
For this advertisement is five days old.
On Wednesday next you, Harry, shall set forward;
On Thursday we ourselves will march:
Our meeting is Bridgenorth:  and, Harry, you
Shall march through Glostershire; by which account,
Our business valued, some twelve days hence
Our general forces at Bridgenorth shall meet.
Our hands are full of business:  let_s away;
Advantage feeds him fat, while men delay.

[Exeunt.]

SCENE III. Eastcheap. A Room in the Boar_s-Head Tavern.

[Enter Falstaff and Bardolph.]

FALSTAFF.
Bardolph, am I not fallen away vilely since this last action? do I not
bate? do I not dwindle? Why, my skin hangs about me like an old lady_s
loose gown; I am withered like an old apple-John. Well, I_ll repent,
and that suddenly, while I am in some liking; I shall be out of heart
shortly, and then I shall have no strength to repent. An I have not
forgotten what the inside of a church is made of, I am a peppercorn, a
brewer_s horse:  the inside of a church! Company, villainous company,
hath been the spoil of me.

BARDOLPH.
Sir John, you are so fretful, you cannot live long.

FALSTAFF.
Why, there is it:  come, sing me a song; make me merry. I was as
virtuously given as a gentleman need to be; virtuous enough; swore
little; diced not above seven times a week; paid money that I borrowed
—three or four times; lived well, and in good compass:  and now I live
out of all order, out of all compass.

BARDOLPH.
Why, you are so fat, Sir John, that you must needs be out of all
compass, —out of all reasonable compass, Sir John.

FALSTAFF.
Do thou amend thy face, and I_ll amend my life:  thou art our admiral,
thou bearest the lantern in the poop,—but _tis in the nose of thee;
thou art the Knight of the Burning Lamp.

BARDOLPH.
Why, Sir John, my face does you no harm.

FALSTAFF.
No, I_ll be sworn; I make as good use of it as many a man doth of a
death_s-head or a memento mori:  I never see thy face but I think upon
hell-fire, and Dives that lived in purple; for there he is in his
robes, burning, burning. If thou wert any way given to virtue, I would
swear by thy face; my oath should be, By this fire, that_s God’s angel:
 but thou art altogether given over; and wert indeed, but for the light
in thy face, the son of utter darkness. When thou rann_st up Gad’s-hill
in the night to catch my horse, if I did not think thou hadst been an
ignis fatuus or a ball of wildfire, there_s no purchase in money. O,
thou art a perpetual triumph, an everlasting bonfire-light! Thou hast
saved me a thousand marks in links and torches, walking with thee in
the night betwixt tavern and tavern:  but the sack that thou hast drunk
me would have bought me lights as good cheap at the dearest chandler_s
in Europe. I have maintain_d that salamander of yours with fire any
time this two-and-thirty years; God reward me for it!

BARDOLPH.
_Sblood, I would my face were in your stomach!

FALSTAFF.
God-a-mercy! so should I be sure to be heart-burn_d.—

[Enter the Hostess.]

How now, Dame Partlet the hen! have you enquir_d yet who pick’d my
pocket?

HOSTESS.
Why, Sir John, what do you think, Sir John? do you think I keep thieves
in my house? I have search_d, I have inquired, so has my husband, man
by man, boy by boy, servant by servant: the tithe of a hair was never
lost in my house before.

FALSTAFF.
Ye lie, hostess:  Bardolph was shaved, and lost many a hair; and
I_ll be sworn my pocket was pick’d. Go to, you are a woman, go.

HOSTESS.
Who, I? no; I defy thee:  God_s light, I was never call’d so in mine
own house before.

FALSTAFF.
Go to, I know you well enough.

HOSTESS.
No, Sir John; you do not know me, Sir John. I know you, Sir John: you
owe me money, Sir John; and now you pick a quarrel to beguile me of it:
I bought you a dozen of shirts to your back.

FALSTAFF.
