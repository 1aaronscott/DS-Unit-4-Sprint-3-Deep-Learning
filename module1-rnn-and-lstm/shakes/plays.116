Dowlas, filthy dowlas:  I have given them away to bakers_ wives, and
they have made bolters of them.

HOSTESS.
Now, as I am a true woman, holland of eight shillings an ell.
You owe money here besides, Sir John, for your diet and by-drinkings,
and money lent you, four-and-twenty pound.

FALSTAFF.
He had his part of it; let him pay.

HOSTESS.
He? alas, he is poor; he hath nothing.

FALSTAFF.
How! poor? look upon his face; what call you rich? let them coin his
nose, let them coin his cheeks:  I_ll not pay a denier. What, will you
make a younker of me? shall I not take mine ease in mine inn, but I
shall have my pocket pick_d? I have lost a seal-ring of my
grandfather_s worth forty mark.

HOSTESS.
O Jesu, I have heard the Prince tell him, I know not how oft, that that
ring was copper!

FALSTAFF.
How! the Prince is a Jack, a sneak-cup:  _sblood, an he were here, I
would cudgel him like a dog, if he would say so.—

[Enter Prince Henry and Poins, marching.  Falstaff meets them, playing
on his truncheon like a fife.]

How now, lad? is the wind in that door, i_faith? must we all march?

BARDOLPH.
Yea, two-and-two, Newgate-fashion.

HOSTESS.
My lord, I pray you, hear me.

PRINCE.
What say_st thou, Mistress Quickly? How doth thy husband? I love him
well; he is an honest man.

HOSTESS.
Good my lord, hear me.

FALSTAFF.
Pr_ythee, let her alone, and list to me.

PRINCE.
What say_st thou, Jack?

FALSTAFF.
The other night I fell asleep here behind the arras, and had my pocket
pick_d:  this house is turn’d bawdy-house; they pick pockets.

PRINCE.
What didst thou lose, Jack?

FALSTAFF.
Wilt thou believe me, Hal? three or four bonds of forty pound a-piece
and a seal-ring of my grandfather_s.

PRINCE.
A trifle, some eight-penny matter.

HOSTESS.
So I told him, my lord; and I said I heard your Grace say so; and, my
lord, he speaks most vilely of you, like a foul-mouth_d man as he is;
and said he would cudgel you.

PRINCE.
What! he did not?

HOSTESS.
There_s neither faith, truth, nor womanhood in me else.

FALSTAFF.
There_s no more faith in thee than in a stew’d prune; nor no more truth
in thee than in a drawn fox; and, for woman-hood, Maid Marian may be
the deputy_s wife of the ward to thee. Go, you thing, go.

HOSTESS.
Say, what thing? what thing?  I am an honest man_s wife:  and, setting
thy knighthood aside, thou art a knave to call me so.

FALSTAFF.
Setting thy womanhood aside, thou art a beast to say otherwise.

HOSTESS.
Say, what beast, thou knave, thou?

FALSTAFF.
What beast!  why, an otter.

PRINCE.
An otter, Sir John, why an otter?

FALSTAFF.
Why, she_s neither fish nor flesh; a man knows not where to have her.

HOSTESS.
Thou art an unjust man in saying so; thou or any man knows where to
have me, thou knave, thou!

PRINCE.
Thou say_st true, hostess; and he slanders thee most grossly.

HOSTESS.
So he doth you, my lord; and said this other day you ought him a
thousand pound.

PRINCE.
Sirrah, do I owe you a thousand pound?

FALSTAFF.

A thousand pound, Hal! a million:  thy love is worth a million; thou
owest me thy love.

HOSTESS.
Nay, my lord, he call_d you Jack, and said he would cudgel you.

FALSTAFF.
Did I, Bardolph?

BARDOLPH.
Indeed, Sir John, you said so.

FALSTAFF.
Yea, if he said my ring was copper.

PRINCE.
I say _tis copper:  darest thou be as good as thy word now?

FALSTAFF.
Why, Hal, thou know_st, as thou art but man, I dare; but as thou art
prince, I fear thee as I fear the roaring of the lion_s whelp.

PRINCE.
And why not as the lion?

FALSTAFF.
The King himself is to be feared as the lion:  dost thou think I_ll
fear thee as I fear thy father? nay, an I do, I pray God my girdle
break.

PRINCE.
Sirrah, there_s no room for faith, truth, nor honesty in this bosom of
thine; it is all fill_d up with midriff. Charge an honest woman with
picking thy pocket! why, thou whoreson, impudent, emboss_d rascal, if
there were anything in thy pocket but tavern-reckonings, and one poor
pennyworth of sugar-candy to make thee long-winded,—if thy pocket were
enrich_d with any other injuries but these, I am a villain:  and yet
you will stand to it; you will not pocket-up wrong. Art thou not
ashamed!

FALSTAFF.
Dost thou hear, Hal? thou know_st, in the state of innocency Adam fell;
and what should poor Jack Falstaff do in the days of villainy? Thou
see_st I have more flesh than another man; and therefore more frailty.
You confess, then, you pick_d my pocket?

PRINCE.
It appears so by the story.

FALSTAFF.
Hostess, I forgive thee:  go, make ready breakfast; love thy husband,
look to thy servants, cherish thy guests:  thou shalt find me tractable
to any honest reason; thou see_st I am pacified.—Still?  Nay, pr’ythee,
be gone.

[Exit Hostess.]

Now, Hal, to the news at Court:  for the robbery, lad, how is that
answered?

PRINCE.
O, my sweet beef, I must still be good angel to thee:  the money is
paid back again.

FALSTAFF.
O, I do not like that paying back; _tis a double labour.

PRINCE.
I am good friends with my father, and may do any thing.

FALSTAFF.
Rob me the exchequer the first thing thou doest, and do it with
unwash_d hands too.

BARDOLPH.
Do, my lord.

PRINCE.
I have procured thee, Jack, a charge of Foot.

FALSTAFF.
I would it had been of Horse. Where shall I find one that can steal
well? O, for a fine thief, of the age of two-and-twenty or thereabouts!
I am heinously unprovided. Well, God be thanked for these rebels; they
offend none but the virtuous:  I laud them, I praise them.

PRINCE.
Bardolph,—

BARDOLPH.
My lord?

PRINCE.
Go bear this letter to Lord John of Lancaster,
To my brother John; this to my Lord of Westmoreland.—

[Exit Bardolph.]

Go, Poins, to horse, to horse; for thou and I
Have thirty miles to ride yet ere dinner-time.—

[Exit Poins.]

Meet me to-morrow, Jack, i_ the Temple-hall
At two o_clock in th’ afternoon:
There shalt thou know thy charge; and there receive
Money and order for their furniture.
The land is burning; Percy stands on high;
And either they or we must lower lie.

[Exit.]

FALSTAFF.
Rare words! brave world!—Hostess, my breakfast; come:—
O, I could wish this tavern were my drum!

[Exit.]

ACT IV

SCENE I. The Rebel Camp near Shrewsbury.

[Enter Hotspur, Worcester, and Douglas.]

HOTSPUR.
Well said, my noble Scot:  if speaking truth
In this fine age were not thought flattery,
Such attribution should the Douglas have,
As not a soldier of this season_s stamp
Should go so general-current through the world.
By God, I cannot flatter; I defy
The tongues of soothers; but a braver place
In my heart_s love hath no man than yourself:
Nay, task me to my word; approve me, lord.

DOUGLAS.
Thou art the king of honour:
No man so potent breathes upon the ground
But I will beard him.

HOTSPUR.
Do so, and _tis well.—

[Enter a Messenger with letters.]

What letters hast thou there?—I can but thank you.

MESSENGER.
These letters come from your father.

HOTSPUR.
Letters from him! why comes he not himself?

MESSENGER.
He cannot come, my lord; he_s grievous sick.

HOTSPUR.
Zwounds! how has he the leisure to be sick
In such a justling time? Who leads his power?
Under whose government come they along?

MESSENGER.
His letters bears his mind, not I, my lord.

WORCESTER.
I pr_ythee, tell me, doth he keep his bed?

MESSENGER.
He did, my lord, four days ere I set forth,
And at the time of my departure thence
He was much fear_d by his physicians.

WORCESTER.
I would the state of time had first been whole
Ere he by sickness had been visited:
His health was never better worth than now.

HOTSPUR.
Sick now! droop now! this sickness doth infect
The very life-blood of our enterprise;
_Tis catching hither, even to our camp.
