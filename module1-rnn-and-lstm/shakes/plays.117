He writes me here, that inward sickness,—
And that his friends by deputation could not
So soon be drawn; no did he think it meet
To lay so dangerous and dear a trust
On any soul removed, but on his own.
Yet doth he give us bold advertisement,
That with our small conjunction we should on,
To see how fortune is disposed to us;
For, as he writes, there is no quailing now,
Because the King is certainly possess_d
Of all our purposes. What say you to it?

WORCESTER.
Your father_s sickness is a maim to us.

HOTSPUR.
A perilous gash, a very limb lopp_d off:—
And yet, in faith, _tis not; his present want
Seems more than we shall find it. Were it good
To set the exact wealth of all our states
All at one cast? to set so rich a main
On the nice hazard of one doubtful hour?
It were not good; for therein should we read
The very bottom and the soul of hope,
The very list, the very utmost bound
Of all our fortunes.

DOUGLAS.
Faith, and so we should;
Where now remains a sweet reversion;
And we may boldly spend upon the hope
Of what is to come in:
A comfort of retirement lives in this.

HOTSPUR.
A rendezvous, a home to fly unto,
If that the Devil and mischance look big
Upon the maidenhead of our affairs.

WORCESTER.
But yet I would your father had been here.
The quality and hair of our attempt
Brooks no division:  it will be thought
By some, that know not why he is away,
That wisdom, loyalty, and mere dislike
Of our proceedings, kept the earl from hence:
And think how such an apprehension
May turn the tide of fearful faction,
And breed a kind of question in our cause;
For well you know we of the offering side
Must keep aloof from strict arbitrement,
And stop all sight-holes, every loop from whence
The eye of reason may pry in upon us.
This absence of your father_s draws a curtain,
That shows the ignorant a kind of fear
Before not dreamt of.

HOTSPUR.
Nay, you strain too far.
I, rather, of his absence make this use:
It lends a lustre and more great opinion,
A larger dare to our great enterprise,
Than if the earl were here; for men must think,
If we, without his help, can make a head
To push against the kingdom, with his help
We shall o_erturn it topsy-turvy down.
Yet all goes well, yet all our joints are whole.

DOUGLAS.
As heart can think:  there is not such a word
Spoke in Scotland as this term of fear.

[Enter Sir Richard Vernon.]

HOTSPUR.
My cousin Vernon! welcome, by my soul.

VERNON.
Pray God my news be worth a welcome, lord.
The Earl of Westmoreland, seven thousand strong,
Is marching hitherwards; with him Prince John.

HOTSPUR.
No harm:  what more?

VERNON.
And further, I have learn_d
The King himself in person is set forth,
Or hitherwards intended speedily,
With strong and mighty preparation.

HOTSPUR.
He shall be welcome too. Where is his son,
The nimble-footed madcap Prince of Wales,
And his comrades, that daff the world aside,
And bid it pass?

VERNON.
All furnish_d, all in arms;
All plumed like estridges that with the wind
Bate it; like eagles having lately bathed;
Glittering in golden coats, like images;
As full of spirit as the month of May
And gorgeous as the Sun at midsummer;
Wanton as youthful goats, wild as young bulls.
I saw young Harry—with his beaver on,
His cuisses on his thighs, gallantly arm_d—
Rise from the ground like feather_d Mercury,
And vault it with such ease into his seat,
As if an angel dropp_d down from the clouds,
To turn and wind a fiery Pegasus,
And witch the world with noble horsemanship.

HOTSPUR.
No more, no more:  worse than the Sun in March,
This praise doth nourish agues. Let them come;
They come like sacrifices in their trim,
And to the fire-eyed maid of smoky war,
All hot and bleeding, will we offer them:
The mailed Mars shall on his altar sit
Up to the ears in blood. I am on fire
To hear this rich reprisal is so nigh,
And yet not ours.—Come, let me taste my horse,
Who is to bear me, like a thunderbolt,
Against the bosom of the Prince of Wales:
Harry and Harry shall, hot horse to horse,
Meet, and ne_er part till one drop down a corse.—
O, that Glendower were come!

VERNON.
There is more news:
I learn_d in Worcester, as I rode along,
He cannot draw his power this fourteen days.

DOUGLAS.
That_s the worst tidings that I hear of yet.

WORCESTER.
Ay, by my faith, that bears a frosty sound.

HOTSPUR.
What may the King_s whole battle reach unto?

VERNON.
To thirty thousand.

HOTSPUR.
Forty let it be:
My father and Glendower being both away,
The powers of us may serve so great a day.
Come, let us take a muster speedily:
Doomsday is near; die all, die merrily.

DOUGLAS.
Talk not of dying:  I am out of fear
Of death or death_s hand for this one half-year.

[Exeunt.]

SCENE II. A public Road near Coventry.

[Enter Falstaff and Bardolph.]

FALSTAFF.
Bardolph, get thee before to Coventry; fill me a bottle of sack:  our
soldiers shall march through; we_ll to Sutton-Co’fil’ to-night.

BARDOLPH.
Will you give me money, captain?

FALSTAFF.
Lay out, lay out.

BARDOLPH.
This bottle makes an angel.

FALSTAFF.
An if it do, take it for thy labour; an if it make twenty,
take them all; I_ll answer the coinage. Bid my lieutenant
Peto meet me at the town_s end.

BARDOLPH.
I will, captain:  farewell.

[Exit.]

FALSTAFF.
If I be not ashamed of my soldiers, I am a soused gurnet. I have
misused the King_s press damnably. I have got, in exchange of a hundred
and fifty soldiers, three hundred and odd pounds. I press_d me none but
good householders, yeomen_s sons; inquired me out contracted bachelors,
such as had been ask_d twice on the banns; such a commodity of warm
slaves as had as lief hear the Devil as a drum; such as fear the report
of a caliver worse than a struck fowl or a hurt wild-duck. I press_d me
none but such toasts-and-butter, with hearts in their bodies no bigger
than pins_-heads, and they have bought out their services; and now my
whole charge consists of ancients, corporals, lieutenants, gentlemen of
companies, slaves as ragged as Lazarus in the painted cloth, where the
glutton_s dogs licked his sores; and such as, indeed, were never
soldiers, but discarded unjust serving-men, younger sons to younger
brothers, revolted tapsters, and ostlers trade-fallen; the cankers of a
calm world and a long peace; ten times more dishonourable ragged than
an old faced ancient:  and such have I, to fill up the rooms of them
that have bought out their services, that you would think that I had a
hundred and fifty tattered Prodigals lately come from swine-keeping,
from eating draff and husks. A mad fellow met me on the way, and told
me I had unloaded all the gibbets, and press_d the dead bodies. No eye
hath seen such scarecrows. I_ll not march through Coventry with them,
that_s flat:  nay, and the villains march wide betwixt the legs, as if
they had gyves on; for, indeed, I had the most of them out of prison.
There_s but a shirt and a half in all my company; and the half-shirt is
two napkins tack_d together and thrown over the shoulders like a
herald_s coat without sleeves; and the shirt, to say the truth, stolen
from my host at Saint Alban_s, or the red-nose innkeeper of Daventry.
But that_s all one; they’ll find linen enough on every hedge.

[Enter Prince Henry and Westmoreland.]

PRINCE.
How now, blown Jack! how now, quilt!

FALSTAFF.
What, Hal! how now, mad wag! what a devil dost thou in
Warwickshire?—My good Lord of Westmoreland, I cry you mercy:
I thought your honour had already been at Shrewsbury.

WESTMORELAND.
Faith, Sir John, _tis more than time that I were there, and you too;
but my powers are there already. The King, I can tell you, looks for us
all:  we must away all, to-night.

FALSTAFF.
Tut, never fear me:  I am as vigilant as a cat to steal cream.

PRINCE.
I think, to steal cream, indeed; for thy theft hath already made thee
butter. But tell me, Jack, whose fellows are these that come after?

FALSTAFF.
Mine, Hal, mine.

PRINCE.
I did never see such pitiful rascals.

FALSTAFF.
Tut, tut; good enough to toss; food for powder, food for powder;
they_ll fill a pit as well as better:  tush, man, mortal men, mortal
men.

WESTMORELAND.
Ay, but, Sir John, methinks they are exceeding poor and bare,—too
beggarly.

FALSTAFF.
Faith, for their poverty, I know not where they had that; and, for
their bareness, I am sure they never learn_d that of me.

PRINCE.
No, I_ll be sworn; unless you call three fingers on the ribs bare. But,
sirrah, make haste:  Percy is already in the field.

[Exit.]

FALSTAFF.
What, is the King encamp_d?

WESTMORELAND.
He is, Sir John:  I fear we shall stay too long.

[Exit.]

FALSTAFF.
Well,
To the latter end of a fray and the beginning of a feast
Fits a dull fighter and a keen guest.

[Exit.]

SCENE III. The Rebel Camp near Shrewsbury.

[Enter Hotspur, Worcester, Douglas, and Vernon.]

HOTSPUR.
We_ll fight with him to-night.

WORCESTER.
It may not be.

DOUGLAS.
You give him, then, advantage.

VERNON.
Not a whit.

HOTSPUR.
Why say you so? looks he not for supply?

VERNON.
So do we.
