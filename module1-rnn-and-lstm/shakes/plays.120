DOUGLAS.
The Lord of Stafford dear to-day hath bought
Thy likeness; for, instead of thee, King Harry,
This sword hath ended him:  so shall it thee,
Unless thou yield thee as my prisoner.

BLUNT.
I was not born a yielder, thou proud Scot;
And thou shalt find a king that will revenge
Lord Stafford_s death.

[They fight, and Blunt is slain. Enter Hotspur.]

HOTSPUR.
O Douglas, hadst thou fought at Holmedon thus,
I never had triumphed o_er a Scot.

DOUGLAS.
All_s done, all’s won; here breathless lies the King.

HOTSPUR.
Where?

DOUGLAS.
Here.

HOTSPUR.
This, Douglas? no; I know this face full well:
A gallant knight he was, his name was Blunt;
Semblably furnish_d like the King himself.

DOUGLAS.
A fool go with thy soul, where_re it goes!
A borrow_d title hast thou bought too dear:
Why didst thou tell me that thou wert a king?

HOTSPUR.
The King hath many marching in his coats.

DOUGLAS.
Now, by my sword, I will kill all his coats;
I_ll murder all his wardrobe piece by piece,
Until I meet the King.

HOTSPUR.
Up, and away!
Our soldiers stand full fairly for the day.

[Exeunt.]

[Alarums. Enter Falstaff.]

FALSTAFF.
Though I could _scape shot-free at London, I fear the shot here; here’s
no scoring but upon the pate.—Soft! who are you? Sir Walter Blunt: 
there_s honour for you! here’s no vanity! I am as hot as molten lead,
and as heavy too:  God keep lead out of me! I need no more weight than
mine own bowels. I have led my ragamuffins where they are peppered: 
there_s not three of my hundred and fifty left alive; and they are for
the town_s end, to beg during life. But who comes here?

[Enter Prince Henry.]

PRINCE.
What, stand_st thou idle here? lend me thy sword:
Many a nobleman lies stark and stiff
Under the hoofs of vaunting enemies,
Whose deaths are yet unrevenged:  I pr_ythee,
Lend me thy sword.

FALSTAFF.
O Hal, I pr_ythee give me leave to breathe awhile. Turk
Gregory never did such deeds in arms as I have done this
day. I have paid Percy, I have made him sure.

PRINCE.
He is indeed; and living to kill thee.
I pr_ythee, lend me thy sword.

FALSTAFF.
Nay, before God, Hal, if Percy be alive, thou gett_st not my sword; but
take my pistol, if thou wilt.

PRINCE.
Give it me:  what, is it in the case?

FALSTAFF.
Ay, Hal. _Tis hot, ’tis hot:  there’s that will sack a city.

[The Prince draws out a bottle of sack.]

What, is_t a time to jest and dally now?

[Throws it at him, and exit.]

FALSTAFF.
Well, if Percy be alive, I_ll pierce him. If he do come in my way, so;
if he do not, if I come in his willingly, let him make a carbonado of
me. I like not such grinning honour as Sir Walter hath:  give me life;
which if I can save, so; if not, honour comes unlooked for, and there_s
an end.

[Exit.]

SCENE IV. Another Part of the Field.

[Alarums. Excursions. Enter King Henry, Prince Henry,
Lancaster, and Westmoreland.]

KING.
I pr_ythee,
Harry, withdraw thyself; thou bleedest too much.—
Lord John of Lancaster, go you unto him.

LANCASTER.
Not I, my lord, unless I did bleed too.

PRINCE.
I do beseech your Majesty, make up,
Lest your retirement do amaze your friends.

KING.
I will do so.—
My Lord of Westmoreland, lead him to his tent.

WESTMORELAND.
Come, my lord, I_ll lead you to your tent.

PRINCE.
Lead me, my lord?  I do not need your help:
And God forbid, a shallow scratch should drive
The Prince of Wales from such a field as this,
Where stain_d nobility lies trodden on,
And rebels_ arms triumph in massacres!

LANCASTER.
We breathe too long:—come, cousin Westmoreland,
Our duty this way lies; for God_s sake, come.

[Exeunt Lancaster and Westmoreland.]

PRINCE.
By Heaven, thou hast deceived me, Lancaster;
I did not think thee lord of such a spirit:
Before, I loved thee as a brother, John;
But now I do respect thee as my soul.

KING.
I saw him hold Lord Percy at the point
With lustier maintenance than I did look for
Of such an ungrown warrior.

PRINCE.
O, this boy
Lends mettle to us all!

[Exit.]

[Alarums. Enter Douglas.]

DOUGLAS.
Another king! they grow like Hydra_s heads:
I am the Douglas, fatal to all those

That wear those colours on them.—What art thou,
That counterfeit_st the person of a king?

KING.
The King himself; who, Douglas, grieves at heart
So many of his shadows thou hast met,
And not the very King. I have two boys
Seek Percy and thyself about the field:
But, seeing thou fall_st on me so luckily,
I will assay thee; so, defend thyself.

DOUGLAS.
I fear thou art another counterfeit;
And yet, in faith, thou bear_st thee like a king:
But mine I_m sure thou art, whoe’er thou be,
And thus I win thee.

[They fight; the King being in danger, re-enter Prince Henry.]

PRINCE.
Hold up thy head, vile Scot, or thou art like
Never to hold it up again! the spirits
Of valiant Shirley, Stafford, Blunt are in my arms:
It is the Prince of Wales that threatens thee;
Who never promiseth but he means to pay.—

[They fight:  Douglas flies.]

Cheerly, my lord:  how fares your Grace?
Sir Nicholas Gawsey hath for succour sent,
And so hath Clifton:  I_ll to Clifton straight.

KING.
Stay, and breathe awhile:
Thou hast redeem_d thy lost opinion;
And show_d thou makest some tender of my life,
In this fair rescue thou hast brought to me.

PRINCE.
O God, they did me too much injury
That ever said I hearken_d for your death!
If it were so, I might have let alone
Th_ insulting hand of Douglas over you,
Which would have been as speedy in your end
As all the poisonous potions in the world,
And saved the treacherous labour of your son.

KING.
Make up to Clifton:  I_ll to Sir Nicholas Gawsey.

[Exit.]

[Enter Hotspur.]

HOTSPUR.
If I mistake not, thou art Harry Monmouth.

PRINCE.
Thou speak_st as if I would deny my name.

HOTSPUR.
My name is Harry Percy.

PRINCE.
Why, then I see
A very valiant rebel of the name.
I am the Prince of Wales; and think not, Percy,
To share with me in glory any more:
Two stars keep not their motion in one sphere;
Nor can one England brook a double reign,
Of Harry Percy and the Prince of Wales.

HOTSPUR.
Nor shall it, Harry; for the hour is come
To end the one of us; and would to God
Thy name in arms were now as great as mine!

PRINCE.
I_ll make it greater ere I part from thee;
And all the budding honours on thy crest
I_ll crop, to make a garland for my head.

HOTSPUR.
I can no longer brook thy vanities.

[They fight.]

[Enter Falstaff.]

FALSTAFF.
Well said, Hal! to it, Hal! Nay, you shall find no boy_s play here, I
can tell you.

[Re-enter Douglas; he fights with Falstaff, who falls down as if he
were dead, and exit Douglas. Hotspure is wounded, and falls.]

HOTSPUR.
O Harry, thou hast robb_d me of my youth!
I better brook the loss of brittle life
Than those proud titles thou hast won of me;
They wound my thoughts worse than thy sword my flesh:
But thoughts the slave of life, and life Time_s fool,
And Time, that takes survey of all the world,
Must have a stop. O, I could prophesy,
But that the earthy and cold hand of death
Lies on my tongue:  no, Percy, thou art dust,
And food for—

[Dies.]

PRINCE.
For worms, brave Percy:  fare thee well, great heart!
Ill-weaved ambition, how much art thou shrunk!
When that this body did contain a spirit,
A kingdom for it was too small a bound;
But now two paces of the vilest earth
Is room enough. This earth that bears thee dead
Bears not alive so stout a gentleman.
If thou wert sensible of courtesy,
I should not make so dear a show of zeal:
But let my favours hide thy mangled face;
And, even in thy behalf, I_ll thank myself
For doing these fair rites of tenderness.
Adieu, and take thy praise with thee to Heaven!
Thy ignominy sleep with thee in the grave,
But not remember_d in thy epitaph!—

[Sees Falstaff on the ground.]

What, old acquaintance? could not all this flesh
Keep in a little life? Poor Jack, farewell!
I could have better spared a better man:
O, I should have a heavy miss of thee,
If I were much in love with vanity!
Death hath not struck so fat a deer to-day,
Though many dearer, in this bloody fray.
