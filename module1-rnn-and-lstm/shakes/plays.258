I hear it by the way; but I will send.
There_s not a one of them but in his house
I keep a servant fee_d. I will tomorrow
(And betimes I will) to the Weird Sisters:
More shall they speak; for now I am bent to know,
By the worst means, the worst. For mine own good,
All causes shall give way: I am in blood
Stepp_d in so far that, should I wade no more,
Returning were as tedious as go o_er.
Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
Which must be acted ere they may be scann_d.

LADY MACBETH.
You lack the season of all natures, sleep.

MACBETH.
Come, we_ll to sleep. My strange and self-abuse
Is the initiate fear that wants hard use.
We are yet but young in deed.

 [_Exeunt._]

SCENE V. The heath.

 Thunder. Enter the three Witches meeting Hecate.

FIRST WITCH.
Why, how now, Hecate? you look angerly.

HECATE.
Have I not reason, beldams as you are,
Saucy and overbold? How did you dare
To trade and traffic with Macbeth
In riddles and affairs of death;
And I, the mistress of your charms,
The close contriver of all harms,
Was never call_d to bear my part,
Or show the glory of our art?
And, which is worse, all you have done
Hath been but for a wayward son,
Spiteful and wrathful; who, as others do,
Loves for his own ends, not for you.
But make amends now: get you gone,
And at the pit of Acheron
Meet me i_ th’ morning: thither he
Will come to know his destiny.
Your vessels and your spells provide,
Your charms, and everything beside.
I am for th_ air; this night I’ll spend
Unto a dismal and a fatal end.
Great business must be wrought ere noon.
Upon the corner of the moon
There hangs a vap_rous drop profound;
I_ll catch it ere it come to ground:
And that, distill_d by magic sleights,
Shall raise such artificial sprites,
As, by the strength of their illusion,
Shall draw him on to his confusion.
He shall spurn fate, scorn death, and bear
His hopes _bove wisdom, grace, and fear.
And you all know, security
Is mortals_ chiefest enemy.

 [_Music and song within, “Come away, come away” &c._]

Hark! I am call_d; my little spirit, see,
Sits in a foggy cloud and stays for me.

 [_Exit._]

FIRST WITCH.
Come, let_s make haste; she’ll soon be back again.

 [_Exeunt._]

SCENE VI. Forres. A Room in the Palace.

 Enter Lennox and another Lord.

LENNOX.
My former speeches have but hit your thoughts,
Which can interpret farther: only, I say,
Thing_s have been strangely borne. The gracious Duncan
Was pitied of Macbeth:—marry, he was dead:—
And the right valiant Banquo walk_d too late;
Whom, you may say, if_t please you, Fleance kill’d,
For Fleance fled. Men must not walk too late.
Who cannot want the thought, how monstrous
It was for Malcolm and for Donalbain
To kill their gracious father? damned fact!
How it did grieve Macbeth! did he not straight,
In pious rage, the two delinquents tear
That were the slaves of drink and thralls of sleep?
Was not that nobly done? Ay, and wisely too;
For _twould have anger’d any heart alive,
To hear the men deny_t. So that, I say,
He has borne all things well: and I do think,
That had he Duncan_s sons under his key
(As, and_t please heaven, he shall not) they should find
What _twere to kill a father; so should Fleance.
But, peace!—for from broad words, and _cause he fail’d
His presence at the tyrant_s feast, I hear,
Macduff lives in disgrace. Sir, can you tell
Where he bestows himself?

LORD.
The son of Duncan,
From whom this tyrant holds the due of birth,
Lives in the English court and is receiv_d
Of the most pious Edward with such grace
That the malevolence of fortune nothing
Takes from his high respect. Thither Macduff
Is gone to pray the holy king, upon his aid
To wake Northumberland, and warlike Siward
That, by the help of these (with Him above
To ratify the work), we may again
Give to our tables meat, sleep to our nights;
Free from our feasts and banquets bloody knives,
Do faithful homage, and receive free honours,
All which we pine for now. And this report
Hath so exasperate the King that he
Prepares for some attempt of war.

LENNOX.
Sent he to Macduff?

LORD.
He did: and with an absolute “Sir, not I,”
The cloudy messenger turns me his back,
And hums, as who should say, “You_ll rue the time
That clogs me with this answer.”

LENNOX.
And that well might
Advise him to a caution, t_ hold what distance
His wisdom can provide. Some holy angel
Fly to the court of England, and unfold
His message ere he come, that a swift blessing
May soon return to this our suffering country
Under a hand accurs_d!

LORD.
I_ll send my prayers with him.

 [_Exeunt._]


ACT IV

SCENE I. A dark Cave. In the middle, a Cauldron Boiling.

 Thunder. Enter the three Witches.

FIRST WITCH.
Thrice the brinded cat hath mew_d.

SECOND WITCH.
Thrice, and once the hedge-pig whin_d.

THIRD WITCH.
Harpier cries:—_Tis time, ’tis time.

FIRST WITCH.
Round about the cauldron go;
In the poison_d entrails throw.—
Toad, that under cold stone
Days and nights has thirty-one
Swelter_d venom sleeping got,
Boil thou first i_ th’ charmed pot!

ALL.
Double, double, toil and trouble;
Fire, burn; and cauldron, bubble.

SECOND WITCH.
Fillet of a fenny snake,
In the cauldron boil and bake;
Eye of newt, and toe of frog,
Wool of bat, and tongue of dog,
Adder_s fork, and blind-worm’s sting,
Lizard_s leg, and howlet’s wing,
For a charm of powerful trouble,
Like a hell-broth boil and bubble.

ALL.
Double, double, toil and trouble;
Fire, burn; and cauldron, bubble.

THIRD WITCH.
Scale of dragon, tooth of wolf,
Witch_s mummy, maw and gulf
Of the ravin_d salt-sea shark,
Root of hemlock digg_d i’ th’ dark,
Liver of blaspheming Jew,
Gall of goat, and slips of yew
Sliver_d in the moon’s eclipse,
Nose of Turk, and Tartar_s lips,
Finger of birth-strangled babe
Ditch-deliver_d by a drab,
Make the gruel thick and slab:
Add thereto a tiger_s chaudron,
For th_ ingredients of our cauldron.

ALL.
Double, double, toil and trouble;
Fire, burn; and cauldron, bubble.

SECOND WITCH.
Cool it with a baboon_s blood.
Then the charm is firm and good.

 Enter Hecate.

HECATE.
O, well done! I commend your pains,
And everyone shall share i_ th’ gains.
And now about the cauldron sing,
Like elves and fairies in a ring,
Enchanting all that you put in.

 [_Music and a song: “Black Spirits,” &c._]

 [_Exit Hecate._]

SECOND WITCH.
By the pricking of my thumbs,
Something wicked this way comes.
Open, locks,
Whoever knocks!

 Enter Macbeth.

MACBETH.
How now, you secret, black, and midnight hags!
What is_t you do?

ALL.
A deed without a name.

MACBETH.
I conjure you, by that which you profess,
(Howe_er you come to know it) answer me:
Though you untie the winds, and let them fight
Against the churches; though the yesty waves
Confound and swallow navigation up;
Though bladed corn be lodg_d, and trees blown down;
Though castles topple on their warders_ heads;
Though palaces and pyramids do slope
Their heads to their foundations; though the treasure
Of nature_s germens tumble all together,
Even till destruction sicken, answer me
To what I ask you.

FIRST WITCH.
Speak.

SECOND WITCH.
Demand.

THIRD WITCH.
We_ll answer.

FIRST WITCH.
Say, if thou_dst rather hear it from our mouths,
Or from our masters?

MACBETH.
Call _em, let me see ’em.

FIRST WITCH.
Pour in sow_s blood, that hath eaten
Her nine farrow; grease that_s sweaten
From the murderer_s gibbet throw
Into the flame.

ALL.
Come, high or low;
Thyself and office deftly show!

 [_Thunder. An Apparition of an armed Head rises._]

MACBETH.
Tell me, thou unknown power,—

FIRST WITCH.
He knows thy thought:
Hear his speech, but say thou naught.

APPARITION.
Macbeth! Macbeth! Macbeth! Beware Macduff;
Beware the Thane of Fife.—Dismiss me.—Enough.

 [_Descends._]

MACBETH.
Whate_er thou art, for thy good caution, thanks;
Thou hast harp_d my fear aright.—But one word more.

FIRST WITCH.
He will not be commanded. Here_s another,
