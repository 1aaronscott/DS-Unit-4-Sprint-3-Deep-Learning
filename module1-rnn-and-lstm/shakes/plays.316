
      DON PEDRO.
      How, how, I pray you? You amaze me: I would have thought her
      spirit had been invincible against all assaults of affection.


      LEONATO.
      I would have sworn it had, my lord; especially against Benedick.


      BENEDICK.
      [_Aside_] I should think this a gull, but that the white-bearded
      fellow speaks it: knavery cannot, sure, hide itself in such
      reverence.


      CLAUDIO.
      [_Aside_] He hath ta_en the infection: hold it up.


      DON PEDRO.
      Hath she made her affection known to Benedick?


      LEONATO.
      No; and swears she never will: that_s her torment.


      CLAUDIO.
      _Tis true, indeed; so your daughter says: ‘Shall I,’ says she,
      ‘that have so oft encountered him with scorn, write to him that I
      love him?_


      LEONATO.
      This says she now when she is beginning to write to him; for
      she_ll be up twenty times a night, and there will she sit in her
      smock till she have writ a sheet of paper: my daughter tells us
      all.


      CLAUDIO.
      Now you talk of a sheet of paper, I remember a pretty jest your
      daughter told us of.


      LEONATO.
      O! when she had writ it, and was reading it over, she found
      Benedick and Beatrice between the sheet?


      CLAUDIO.
      That.


      LEONATO.
      O! she tore the letter into a thousand halfpence; railed at
      herself, that she should be so immodest to write to one that she
      knew would flout her: ‘I measure him,_ says she, ‘by my own
      spirit; for I should flout him, if he writ to me; yea, though I
      love him, I should._


      CLAUDIO.
      Then down upon her knees she falls, weeps, sobs, beats her heart,
      tears her hair, prays, curses; ‘O sweet Benedick! God give me
      patience!_


      LEONATO.
      She doth indeed; my daughter says so; and the ecstasy hath so
      much overborne her, that my daughter is sometimes afeard she will
      do a desperate outrage to herself. It is very true.


      DON PEDRO.
      It were good that Benedick knew of it by some other, if she will
      not discover it.


      CLAUDIO.
      To what end? he would make but a sport of it and torment the poor
      lady worse.


      DON PEDRO.
      And he should, it were an alms to hang him. She_s an excellent
      sweet lady, and, out of all suspicion, she is virtuous.


      CLAUDIO.
      And she is exceeding wise.


      DON PEDRO.
      In everything but in loving Benedick.


      LEONATO.
      O! my lord, wisdom and blood combating in so tender a body, we
      have ten proofs to one that blood hath the victory. I am sorry
      for her, as I have just cause, being her uncle and her guardian.


      DON PEDRO.
      I would she had bestowed this dotage on me; I would have daffed
      all other respects and made her half myself. I pray you, tell
      Benedick of it, and hear what he will say.


      LEONATO.
      Were it good, think you?


      CLAUDIO.
      Hero thinks surely she will die; for she says she will die if he
      love her not, and she will die ere she make her love known, and
      she will die if he woo her, rather than she will bate one breath
      of her accustomed crossness.


      DON PEDRO.
      She doth well: if she should make tender of her love, _tis very
      possible he_ll scorn it; for the man,—as you know all,—hath a
      contemptible spirit.


      CLAUDIO.
      He is a very proper man.


      DON PEDRO.
      He hath indeed a good outward happiness.


      CLAUDIO.
      _Fore God, and in my mind, very wise.


      DON PEDRO.
      He doth indeed show some sparks that are like wit.


      CLAUDIO.
      And I take him to be valiant.


      DON PEDRO.
      As Hector, I assure you: and in the managing of quarrels you may
      say he is wise; for either he avoids them with great discretion,
      or undertakes them with a most Christian-like fear.


      LEONATO.
      If he do fear God, a_ must necessarily keep peace: if he break
      the peace, he ought to enter into a quarrel with fear and
      trembling.


      DON PEDRO.
      And so will he do; for the man doth fear God, howsoever it seems
      not in him by some large jests he will make. Well, I am sorry for
      your niece. Shall we go seek Benedick and tell him of her love?


      CLAUDIO.
      Never tell him, my lord: let her wear it out with good counsel.


      LEONATO.
      Nay, that_s impossible: she may wear her heart out first.


      DON PEDRO.
      Well, we will hear further of it by your daughter: let it cool
      the while. I love Benedick well, and I could wish he would
      modestly examine himself, to see how much he is unworthy so good
      a lady.


      LEONATO.
      My lord, will you walk? dinner is ready.


      CLAUDIO.
      [_Aside_] If he do not dote on her upon this, I will never trust
      my expectation.


      DON PEDRO.
      [_Aside_] Let there be the same net spread for her; and that must
      your daughter and her gentlewoman carry. The sport will be, when
      they hold one an opinion of another_s dotage, and no such matter:
      that_s the scene that I would see, which will be merely a dumb
      show. Let us send her to call him in to dinner.


      [_Exeunt Don Pedro, Claudio and Leonato._]


      BENEDICK.
      [_Advancing from the arbour._] This can be no trick: the
      conference was sadly borne. They have the truth of this from
      Hero. They seem to pity the lady: it seems her affections have
      their full bent. Love me? why, it must be requited. I hear how I
      am censured: they say I will bear myself proudly, if I perceive
      the love come from her; they say too that she will rather die
      than give any sign of affection. I did never think to marry: I
      must not seem proud: happy are they that hear their detractions,
      and can put them to mending. They say the lady is fair: _tis a
      truth, I can bear them witness; and virtuous: _tis so, I cannot
      reprove it; and wise, but for loving me: by my troth, it is no
      addition to her wit, nor no great argument of her folly, for I
      will be horribly in love with her. I may chance have some odd
      quirks and remnants of wit broken on me, because I have railed so
      long against marriage; but doth not the appetite alter? A man
      loves the meat in his youth that he cannot endure in his age.
      Shall quips and sentences and these paper bullets of the brain
      awe a man from the career of his humour? No; the world must be
      peopled. When I said I would die a bachelor, I did not think I
      should live till I were married. Here comes Beatrice. By this
      day! she_s a fair lady: I do spy some marks of love in her.


      Enter Beatrice.


      BEATRICE.
      Against my will I am sent to bid you come in to dinner.


      BENEDICK.
      Fair Beatrice, I thank you for your pains.


      BEATRICE.
      I took no more pains for those thanks than you take pains to
      thank me: if it had been painful, I would not have come.


      BENEDICK.
      You take pleasure then in the message?


      BEATRICE.
      Yea, just so much as you may take upon a knife_s point, and choke
      a daw withal. You have no stomach, signior: fare you well.


      [_Exit._]


      BENEDICK.
      Ha! ‘Against my will I am sent to bid you come in to dinner,_
      there_s a double meaning in that. ‘I took no more pains for those
      thanks than you took pains to thank me,_ that’s as much as to
      say, Any pains that I take for you is as easy as thanks. If I do
      not take pity of her, I am a villain; if I do not love her, I am
      a Jew. I will go get her picture.


      [_Exit._]





ACT III

SCENE I. Leonato_s Garden.

      Enter Hero, Margaret and Ursula.


      HERO.
      Good Margaret, run thee to the parlour;
      There shalt thou find my cousin Beatrice
      Proposing with the Prince and Claudio:
      Whisper her ear, and tell her, I and Ursala
      Walk in the orchard, and our whole discourse
      Is all of her; say that thou overheard_st us,
      And bid her steal into the pleached bower,
      Where honey-suckles, ripen_d by the sun,
      Forbid the sun to enter; like favourites,
      Made proud by princes, that advance their pride
      Against that power that bred it. There will she hide her,
      To listen our propose. This is thy office;
      Bear thee well in it and leave us alone.


      MARGARET.
      I_ll make her come, I warrant you, presently.


      [_Exit._]


      HERO.
      Now, Ursula, when Beatrice doth come,
      As we do trace this alley up and down,
