ARIEL.
No.

PROSPERO.
Thou dost, and think_st it much to tread the ooze
Of the salt deep,
To run upon the sharp wind of the north,
To do me business in the veins o_ th’ earth
When it is bak_d with frost.

ARIEL.
I do not, sir.

PROSPERO.
Thou liest, malignant thing! Hast thou forgot
The foul witch Sycorax, who with age and envy
Was grown into a hoop? Hast thou forgot her?

ARIEL.
No, sir.

PROSPERO.
Thou hast. Where was she born? Speak; tell me.

ARIEL.
Sir, in Argier.

PROSPERO.
O, was she so? I must
Once in a month recount what thou hast been,
Which thou forget_st. This damn’d witch Sycorax,
For mischiefs manifold, and sorceries terrible
To enter human hearing, from Argier,
Thou know_st, was banish’d: for one thing she did
They would not take her life. Is not this true?

ARIEL.
Ay, sir.

PROSPERO.
This blue-ey_d hag was hither brought with child,
And here was left by th_ sailors. Thou, my slave,
As thou report_st thyself, wast then her servant;
And, for thou wast a spirit too delicate
To act her earthy and abhorr_d commands,
Refusing her grand hests, she did confine thee,
By help of her more potent ministers,
And in her most unmitigable rage,
Into a cloven pine; within which rift
Imprison_d, thou didst painfully remain
A dozen years; within which space she died,
And left thee there, where thou didst vent thy groans
As fast as mill-wheels strike. Then was this island—
Save for the son that she did litter here,
A freckl_d whelp, hag-born—not honour’d with
A human shape.

ARIEL.
Yes, Caliban her son.

PROSPERO.
Dull thing, I say so; he, that Caliban,
Whom now I keep in service. Thou best know_st
What torment I did find thee in; thy groans
Did make wolves howl, and penetrate the breasts
Of ever-angry bears: it was a torment
To lay upon the damn_d, which Sycorax
Could not again undo; it was mine art,
When I arriv_d and heard thee, that made gape
The pine, and let thee out.

ARIEL.
I thank thee, master.

PROSPERO.
If thou more murmur_st, I will rend an oak
And peg thee in his knotty entrails till
Thou hast howl_d away twelve winters.

ARIEL.
Pardon, master:
I will be correspondent to command,
And do my spriting gently.

PROSPERO.
Do so; and after two days
I will discharge thee.

ARIEL.
That_s my noble master!
What shall I do? Say what? What shall I do?

PROSPERO.
Go make thyself like a nymph o_ th’ sea. Be subject
To no sight but thine and mine; invisible
To every eyeball else. Go, take this shape,
And hither come in _t. Go, hence with diligence!

 [_Exit Ariel._]

Awake, dear heart, awake! thou hast slept well;
Awake!

MIRANDA.
[_Waking._] The strangeness of your story put
Heaviness in me.

PROSPERO.
Shake it off. Come on;
We_ll visit Caliban my slave, who never
Yields us kind answer.

MIRANDA.
_Tis a villain, sir,
I do not love to look on.

PROSPERO.
But as _tis,
We cannot miss him: he does make our fire,
Fetch in our wood; and serves in offices
That profit us. What ho! slave! Caliban!
Thou earth, thou! Speak.

CALIBAN.
[_Within._] There_s wood enough within.

PROSPERO.
Come forth, I say; there_s other business for thee.
Come, thou tortoise! when?

 Re-enter Ariel like a water-nymph.

Fine apparition! My quaint Ariel,
Hark in thine ear.

ARIEL.
My lord, it shall be done.

 [_Exit._]

PROSPERO.
Thou poisonous slave, got by the devil himself
Upon thy wicked dam, come forth!

 Enter Caliban.

CALIBAN.
As wicked dew as e_er my mother brush’d
With raven_s feather from unwholesome fen
Drop on you both! A south-west blow on ye,
And blister you all o_er!

PROSPERO.
For this, be sure, tonight thou shalt have cramps,
Side-stitches that shall pen thy breath up; urchins
Shall forth at vast of night that they may work
All exercise on thee. Thou shalt be pinch_d
As thick as honeycomb, each pinch more stinging
Than bees that made them.

CALIBAN.
I must eat my dinner.
This island_s mine, by Sycorax my mother,
Which thou tak_st from me. When thou cam’st first,
Thou strok_st me and made much of me; wouldst give me
Water with berries in _t; and teach me how
To name the bigger light, and how the less,
That burn by day and night: and then I lov_d thee,
And show_d thee all the qualities o’ th’ isle,
The fresh springs, brine-pits, barren place, and fertile.
Curs_d be I that did so! All the charms
Of Sycorax, toads, beetles, bats, light on you!
For I am all the subjects that you have,
Which first was mine own King; and here you sty me
In this hard rock, whiles you do keep from me
The rest o_ th’ island.

PROSPERO.
Thou most lying slave,
Whom stripes may move, not kindness! I have us_d thee,
Filth as thou art, with human care, and lodg_d thee
In mine own cell, till thou didst seek to violate
The honour of my child.

CALIBAN.
Oh ho! Oh ho! Would _t had been done!
Thou didst prevent me; I had peopled else
This isle with Calibans.

PROSPERO.
Abhorred slave,
Which any print of goodness wilt not take,
Being capable of all ill! I pitied thee,
Took pains to make thee speak, taught thee each hour
One thing or other: when thou didst not, savage,
Know thine own meaning, but wouldst gabble like
A thing most brutish, I endow_d thy purposes
With words that made them known. But thy vile race,
Though thou didst learn, had that in _t which good natures
Could not abide to be with; therefore wast thou
Deservedly confin_d into this rock,
Who hadst deserv_d more than a prison.

CALIBAN.
You taught me language, and my profit on _t
Is, I know how to curse. The red plague rid you,
For learning me your language!

PROSPERO.
Hag-seed, hence!
Fetch us in fuel; and be quick, thou _rt best,
To answer other business. Shrug_st thou, malice?
If thou neglect_st, or dost unwillingly
What I command, I_ll rack thee with old cramps,
Fill all thy bones with aches, make thee roar,
That beasts shall tremble at thy din.

CALIBAN.
No, pray thee.
[_Aside._] I must obey. His art is of such power,
It would control my dam_s god, Setebos,
And make a vassal of him.

PROSPERO.
So, slave, hence!

 [_Exit Caliban._]

 Re-enter Ariel, playing and singing; Ferdinand following.

ARIEL_S SONG.


_Come unto these yellow sands,
    And then take hands:
Curtsied when you have, and kiss_d
    The wild waves whist.
Foot it featly here and there,
    And sweet sprites bear
The burden. Hark, hark!_
    Burden dispersedly. _Bow-wow.
The watch dogs bark._
    [Burden dispersedly.] _Bow-wow.
Hark, hark! I hear
The strain of strutting chanticleer
    Cry cock-a-diddle-dow._

FERDINAND.
Where should this music be? i_ th’ air or th’ earth?
It sounds no more; and sure it waits upon
Some god o_ th’ island. Sitting on a bank,
Weeping again the King my father_s wrack,
This music crept by me upon the waters,
Allaying both their fury and my passion
With its sweet air: thence I have follow_d it,
Or it hath drawn me rather,—but _tis gone.
No, it begins again.

ARIEL.
[_Sings._]
_Full fathom five thy father lies.
    Of his bones are coral made.
Those are pearls that were his eyes.
    Nothing of him that doth fade
But doth suffer a sea-change
Into something rich and strange.
Sea-nymphs hourly ring his knell:_
    Burden: _Ding-dong.
Hark! now I hear them: ding-dong, bell._

FERDINAND.
The ditty does remember my drown_d father.
This is no mortal business, nor no sound
That the earth owes:—I hear it now above me.

PROSPERO.
The fringed curtains of thine eye advance,
And say what thou seest yond.

MIRANDA.
What is_t? a spirit?
Lord, how it looks about! Believe me, sir,
It carries a brave form. But _tis a spirit.

PROSPERO.
No, wench; it eats and sleeps and hath such senses
As we have, such. This gallant which thou seest
Was in the wrack; and, but he_s something stain’d
With grief,—that_s beauty’s canker,—thou mightst call him
A goodly person: he hath lost his fellows
And strays about to find _em.

MIRANDA.
I might call him
A thing divine; for nothing natural
I ever saw so noble.

PROSPERO.
[_Aside._] It goes on, I see,
As my soul prompts it. Spirit, fine spirit! I_ll free thee
