cloud, yond huge one, looks like a foul bombard that would shed his
liquor. If it should thunder as it did before, I know not where to hide
my head: yond same cloud cannot choose but fall by pailfuls. What have
we here? a man or a fish? dead or alive? A fish: he smells like a fish;
a very ancient and fish-like smell; a kind of not of the newest
Poor-John. A strange fish! Were I in England now, as once I was, and
had but this fish painted, not a holiday fool there but would give a
piece of silver: there would this monster make a man; any strange beast
there makes a man. When they will not give a doit to relieve a lame
beggar, they will lay out ten to see a dead Indian. Legg_d like a man,
and his fins like arms! Warm, o_ my troth! I do now let loose my
opinion, hold it no longer: this is no fish, but an islander, that hath
lately suffered by thunderbolt. [_Thunder._] Alas, the storm is come
again! My best way is to creep under his gaberdine; there is no other
shelter hereabout: misery acquaints a man with strange bed-fellows. I
will here shroud till the dregs of the storm be past.

 Enter Stephano singing; a bottle in his hand.

STEPHANO.
_I shall no more to sea, to sea,
Here shall I die ashore—_

This is a very scurvy tune to sing at a man_s funeral.
Well, here_s my comfort.

 [_Drinks._]

_The master, the swabber, the boatswain, and I,
    The gunner, and his mate,
Lov_d Mall, Meg, and Marian, and Margery,
    But none of us car_d for Kate:
    For she had a tongue with a tang,
    Would cry to a sailor “Go hang!”
She lov_d not the savour of tar nor of pitch,
Yet a tailor might scratch her where_er she did itch.
    Then to sea, boys, and let her go hang._

This is a scurvy tune too: but here_s my comfort.

 [_Drinks._]

CALIBAN.
Do not torment me: O!

STEPHANO.
What_s the matter? Have we devils here? Do you put tricks upon ’s with
savages and men of Ind? Ha? I have not scap_d drowning, to be afeard
now of your four legs; for it hath been said, As proper a man as ever
went on four legs cannot make him give ground; and it shall be said so
again, while Stephano breathes at_ nostrils.

CALIBAN.
The spirit torments me: O!

STEPHANO.
This is some monster of the isle with four legs, who hath got, as I
take it, an ague. Where the devil should he learn our language? I will
give him some relief, if it be but for that. If I can recover him and
keep him tame, and get to Naples with him, he_s a present for any
emperor that ever trod on neat_s-leather.

CALIBAN.
Do not torment me, prithee; I_ll bring my wood home faster.

STEPHANO.
He_s in his fit now, and does not talk after the wisest. He shall taste
of my bottle: if he have never drunk wine afore, it will go near to
remove his fit. If I can recover him, and keep him tame, I will not
take too much for him. He shall pay for him that hath him, and that
soundly.

CALIBAN.
Thou dost me yet but little hurt; thou wilt anon,
I know it by thy trembling: now Prosper works upon thee.

STEPHANO.
Come on your ways. Open your mouth; here is that which will give
language to you, cat. Open your mouth. This will shake your shaking, I
can tell you, and that soundly. [_gives Caliban a drink_] You cannot
tell who_s your friend: open your chaps again.

TRINCULO.
I should know that voice: it should be—but he is drowned; and these are
devils. O, defend me!

STEPHANO.
Four legs and two voices; a most delicate monster! His forward voice
now is to speak well of his friend; his backward voice is to utter foul
speeches and to detract. If all the wine in my bottle will recover him,
I will help his ague. Come. Amen! I will pour some in thy other mouth.

TRINCULO.
Stephano!

STEPHANO.
Doth thy other mouth call me? Mercy! mercy!
This is a devil, and no monster: I will leave him; I
have no long spoon.

TRINCULO.
Stephano! If thou beest Stephano, touch me, and speak to me; for I am
Trinculo—be not afeared—thy good friend Trinculo.

STEPHANO.
If thou beest Trinculo, come forth. I_ll pull thee by the lesser legs:
if any be Trinculo_s legs, these are they. Thou art very Trinculo
indeed! How cam_st thou to be the siege of this moon-calf? Can he vent
Trinculos?

TRINCULO.
I took him to be kill_d with a thunderstroke. But art thou not drown’d,
Stephano? I hope now thou are not drown_d. Is the storm overblown? I
hid me under the dead moon-calf_s gaberdine for fear of the storm. And
art thou living, Stephano? O Stephano, two Neapolitans scap_d!

STEPHANO.
Prithee, do not turn me about. My stomach is not constant.

CALIBAN.
[_Aside._] These be fine things, an if they be not sprites.
That_s a brave god, and bears celestial liquor.
I will kneel to him.

STEPHANO.
How didst thou scape? How cam_st thou hither? Swear by  this bottle how
thou cam_st hither—I escaped upon a butt of sack, which the sailors
heaved o_erboard, by this bottle! which I made of the bark of a tree
with mine own hands, since I was cast ashore.

CALIBAN.
I_ll swear upon that bottle to be thy true subject, for the liquor is
not earthly.

STEPHANO.
Here. Swear then how thou escapedst.

TRINCULO.
Swum ashore, man, like a duck: I can swim like a duck, I_ll be sworn.

STEPHANO.
Here, kiss the book. Though thou canst swim like a duck, thou art made
like a goose.

TRINCULO.
O Stephano, hast any more of this?

STEPHANO.
The whole butt, man: my cellar is in a rock by th_ seaside, where my
wine is hid. How now, moon-calf! How does thine ague?

CALIBAN.
Hast thou not dropped from heaven?

STEPHANO.
Out o_ the moon, I do assure thee: I was the Man in the Moon, when time
was.

CALIBAN.
I have seen thee in her, and I do adore thee. My mistress showed me
thee, and thy dog, and thy bush.

STEPHANO.
Come, swear to that. Kiss the book. I will furnish it anon with new
contents. Swear.

TRINCULO.
By this good light, this is a very shallow monster. I afeard of him? A
very weak monster. The Man i_ the Moon! A most poor credulous monster!
Well drawn, monster, in good sooth!

CALIBAN.
I_ll show thee every fertile inch o’ the island; and I will kiss thy
foot. I prithee, be my god.

TRINCULO.
By this light, a most perfidious and drunken monster. When _s god’s
asleep, he_ll rob his bottle.

CALIBAN.
I_ll kiss thy foot. I’ll swear myself thy subject.

STEPHANO.
Come on, then; down, and swear.

TRINCULO.
I shall laugh myself to death at this puppy-headed monster. A most
scurvy monster! I could find in my heart to beat him,—

STEPHANO.
Come, kiss.

TRINCULO.
But that the poor monster_s in drink. An abominable monster!

CALIBAN.
I_ll show thee the best springs; I’ll pluck thee berries;
I_ll fish for thee, and get thee wood enough.
A plague upon the tyrant that I serve!
I_ll bear him no more sticks, but follow thee,
Thou wondrous man.

TRINCULO.
A most ridiculous monster, to make a wonder of a poor drunkard!

CALIBAN.
I prithee, let me bring thee where crabs grow;
And I with my long nails will dig thee pig-nuts;
Show thee a jay_s nest, and instruct thee how
To snare the nimble marmoset; I_ll bring thee
To clustering filberts, and sometimes I_ll get thee
Young scamels from the rock. Wilt thou go with me?

STEPHANO.
I prithee now, lead the way without any more talking. Trinculo, the
King and all our company else being drowned, we will inherit here.
Here, bear my bottle. Fellow Trinculo, we_ll fill him by and by again.

CALIBAN.
[_Sings drunkenly._] _Farewell, master; farewell, farewell!_

TRINCULO.
A howling monster, a drunken monster.

CALIBAN.
_No more dams I_ll make for fish;
Nor fetch in firing
At requiring,
Nor scrape trenchering, nor wash dish;
_Ban ’Ban, Cacaliban,
Has a new master—Get a new man._
Freedom, high-day! high-day, freedom! freedom,
high-day, freedom!

STEPHANO.
O brave monster! lead the way.

 [_Exeunt._]



ACT III

SCENE I. Before Prospero_s cell.

 Enter Ferdinand bearing a log.

FERDINAND.
There be some sports are painful, and their labour
Delight in them sets off: some kinds of baseness
Are nobly undergone; and most poor matters
Point to rich ends. This my mean task
Would be as heavy to me as odious, but
The mistress which I serve quickens what_s dead,
And makes my labours pleasures: O, she is
Ten times more gentle than her father_s crabbed,
And he_s compos’d of harshness. I must remove
Some thousands of these logs, and pile them up,
Upon a sore injunction: my sweet mistress
Weeps when she sees me work, and says such baseness
Had never like executor. I forget:
But these sweet thoughts do even refresh my labours,
Most busy, least when I do it.

 Enter Miranda and Prospero behind.

MIRANDA.
Alas now, pray you,
Work not so hard: I would the lightning had
Burnt up those logs that you are enjoin_d to pile!
Pray, set it down and rest you. When this burns,
_Twill weep for having wearied you. My father
Is hard at study; pray, now, rest yourself:
He_s safe for these three hours.

FERDINAND.
O most dear mistress,
The sun will set, before I shall discharge
What I must strive to do.

MIRANDA.
If you_ll sit down,
I_ll bear your logs the while. Pray give me that;
I_ll carry it to the pile.

FERDINAND.
No, precious creature;
I had rather crack my sinews, break my back,
Than you should such dishonour undergo,
While I sit lazy by.

MIRANDA.
It would become me
As well as it does you: and I should do it
With much more ease; for my good will is to it,
And yours it is against.

PROSPERO.
[_Aside._] Poor worm! thou art infected.
This visitation shows it.
