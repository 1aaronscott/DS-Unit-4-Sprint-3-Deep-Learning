  There shall not be one minute in an hour
  Wherein I will not kiss my sweet love_s flower.‚Äù

Thus weary of the world, away she hies,             1189
And yokes her silver doves; by whose swift aid
Their mistress mounted through the empty skies,
In her light chariot quickly is convey_d;           1192
  Holding their course to Paphos, where their queen
  Means to immure herself and not be seen.
