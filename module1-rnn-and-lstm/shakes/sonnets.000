From fairest creatures we desire increase,
That thereby beauty_s rose might never die,
But as the riper should by time decease,
His tender heir might bear his memory:
But thou contracted to thine own bright eyes,
Feed_st thy lightâ€™s flame with self-substantial fuel,
Making a famine where abundance lies,
Thy self thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel:
Thou that art now the world_s fresh ornament,
And only herald to the gaudy spring,
Within thine own bud buriest thy content,
And, tender churl, mak_st waste in niggarding:
  Pity the world, or else this glutton be,
  To eat the world_s due, by the grave and thee.
