Shall I compare thee to a summer_s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate:
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer_s lease hath all too short a date:
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed,
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature_s changing course untrimmed:
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow_st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand_rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to time thou grow_st,
  So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,
  So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
