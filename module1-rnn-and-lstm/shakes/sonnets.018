Devouring Time blunt thou the lion_s paws,
And make the earth devour her own sweet brood,
Pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger_s jaws,
And burn the long-lived phoenix, in her blood,
Make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleet_st,
And do whate_er thou wilt swift-footed Time
To the wide world and all her fading sweets:
But I forbid thee one most heinous crime,
O carve not with thy hours my love_s fair brow,
Nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen,
Him in thy course untainted do allow,
For beauty_s pattern to succeeding men.
  Yet do thy worst old Time: despite thy wrong,
  My love shall in my verse ever live young.
