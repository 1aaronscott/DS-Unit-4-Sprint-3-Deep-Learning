A woman_s face with nature’s own hand painted,
Hast thou the master mistress of my passion,
A woman_s gentle heart but not acquainted
With shifting change as is false women_s fashion,
An eye more bright than theirs, less false in rolling:
Gilding the object whereupon it gazeth,
A man in hue all hues in his controlling,
Which steals men_s eyes and women’s souls amazeth.
And for a woman wert thou first created,
Till nature as she wrought thee fell a-doting,
And by addition me of thee defeated,
By adding one thing to my purpose nothing.
  But since she pricked thee out for women_s pleasure,
  Mine be thy love and thy love_s use their treasure.
