So is it not with me as with that muse,
Stirred by a painted beauty to his verse,
Who heaven it self for ornament doth use,
And every fair with his fair doth rehearse,
Making a couplement of proud compare
With sun and moon, with earth and sea_s rich gems:
With April_s first-born flowers and all things rare,
That heaven_s air in this huge rondure hems.
O let me true in love but truly write,
And then believe me, my love is as fair,
As any mother_s child, though not so bright
As those gold candles fixed in heaven_s air:
  Let them say more that like of hearsay well,
  I will not praise that purpose not to sell.
