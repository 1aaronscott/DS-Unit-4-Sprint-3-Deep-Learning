Why didst thou promise such a beauteous day,
And make me travel forth without my cloak,
To let base clouds o_ertake me in my way,
Hiding thy brav_ry in their rotten smoke?
_Tis not enough that through the cloud thou break,
To dry the rain on my storm-beaten face,
For no man well of such a salve can speak,
That heals the wound, and cures not the disgrace:
Nor can thy shame give physic to my grief,
Though thou repent, yet I have still the loss,
Th_ offenderâ€™s sorrow lends but weak relief
To him that bears the strong offence_s cross.
  Ah but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds,
  And they are rich, and ransom all ill deeds.
