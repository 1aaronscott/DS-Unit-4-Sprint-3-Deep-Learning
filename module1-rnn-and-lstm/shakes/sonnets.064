                    65

Since brass, nor stone, nor earth, nor boundless sea,
But sad mortality o_ersways their power,
How with this rage shall beauty hold a plea,
Whose action is no stronger than a flower?
O how shall summer_s honey breath hold out,
Against the wrackful siege of batt_ring days,
When rocks impregnable are not so stout,
Nor gates of steel so strong but time decays?
O fearful meditation, where alack,
Shall Time_s best jewel from Timeâ€™s chest lie hid?
Or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back,
Or who his spoil of beauty can forbid?
  O none, unless this miracle have might,
  That in black ink my love may still shine bright.
