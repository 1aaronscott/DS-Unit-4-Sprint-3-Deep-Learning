The forward violet thus did I chide,
Sweet thief, whence didst thou steal thy sweet that smells,
If not from my love_s breath? The purple pride
Which on thy soft check for complexion dwells,
In my love_s veins thou hast too grossly dyed.
The lily I condemned for thy hand,
And buds of marjoram had stol_n thy hair,
The roses fearfully on thorns did stand,
One blushing shame, another white despair:
A third nor red, nor white, had stol_n of both,
And to his robbery had annexed thy breath,
But for his theft in pride of all his growth
A vengeful canker eat him up to death.
  More flowers I noted, yet I none could see,
  But sweet, or colour it had stol_n from thee.
