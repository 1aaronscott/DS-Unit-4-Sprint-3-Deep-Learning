O truant Muse what shall be thy amends,
For thy neglect of truth in beauty dyed?
Both truth and beauty on my love depends:
So dost thou too, and therein dignified:
Make answer Muse, wilt thou not haply say,
_Truth needs no colour with his colour fixed,
Beauty no pencil, beauty_s truth to lay:
But best is best, if never intermixed_?
Because he needs no praise, wilt thou be dumb?
Excuse not silence so, for_t lies in thee,
To make him much outlive a gilded tomb:
And to be praised of ages yet to be.
  Then do thy office Muse, I teach thee how,
  To make him seem long hence, as he shows now.
