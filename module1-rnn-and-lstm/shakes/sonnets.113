Or whether doth my mind being crowned with you
Drink up the monarch_s plague this flattery?
Or whether shall I say mine eye saith true,
And that your love taught it this alchemy?
To make of monsters, and things indigest,
Such cherubins as your sweet self resemble,
Creating every bad a perfect best
As fast as objects to his beams assemble:
O _tis the first, â€™tis flattery in my seeing,
And my great mind most kingly drinks it up,
Mine eye well knows what with his gust is _greeing,
And to his palate doth prepare the cup.
  If it be poisoned, _tis the lesser sin,
  That mine eye loves it and doth first begin.
