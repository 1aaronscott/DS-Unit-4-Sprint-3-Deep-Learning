Those lines that I before have writ do lie,
Even those that said I could not love you dearer,
Yet then my judgment knew no reason why,
My most full flame should afterwards burn clearer,
But reckoning time, whose millioned accidents
Creep in _twixt vows, and change decrees of kings,
Tan sacred beauty, blunt the sharp_st intents,
Divert strong minds to the course of alt_ring things:
Alas why fearing of time_s tyranny,
Might I not then say â€˜Now I love you best,_
When I was certain o_er incertainty,
Crowning the present, doubting of the rest?
  Love is a babe, then might I not say so
  To give full growth to that which still doth grow.
