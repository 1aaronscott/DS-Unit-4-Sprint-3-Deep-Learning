O thou my lovely boy who in thy power,
Dost hold Time_s fickle glass his fickle hour:
Who hast by waning grown, and therein show_st,
Thy lovers withering, as thy sweet self grow_st.
If Nature (sovereign mistress over wrack)
As thou goest onwards still will pluck thee back,
She keeps thee to this purpose, that her skill
May time disgrace, and wretched minutes kill.
Yet fear her O thou minion of her pleasure,
She may detain, but not still keep her treasure!
  Her audit (though delayed) answered must be,
  And her quietus is to render thee.
