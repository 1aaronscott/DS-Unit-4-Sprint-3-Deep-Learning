
In the old age black was not counted fair,
Or if it were it bore not beauty_s name:
But now is black beauty_s successive heir,
And beauty slandered with a bastard shame,
For since each hand hath put on nature_s power,
Fairing the foul with art_s false borrowed face,
Sweet beauty hath no name no holy bower,
But is profaned, if not lives in disgrace.
Therefore my mistress_ eyes are raven black,
Her eyes so suited, and they mourners seem,
At such who not born fair no beauty lack,
Slandering creation with a false esteem,
  Yet so they mourn becoming of their woe,
  That every tongue says beauty should look so.
