
Those lips that Love_s own hand did make,
Breathed forth the sound that said ‘I hate_,
To me that languished for her sake:
But when she saw my woeful state,
Straight in her heart did mercy come,
Chiding that tongue that ever sweet,
Was used in giving gentle doom:
And taught it thus anew to greet:
‘I hate_ she altered with an end,
That followed it as gentle day,
Doth follow night who like a fiend
From heaven to hell is flown away.
  ‘I hate_, from hate away she threw,
  And saved my life saying ‘not you_.
